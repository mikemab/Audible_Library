He makes his son promise to give up his life of crime, and Artemis has to go along with it. But not until he has completed one last scheme.</p> <p>Artemis has constructed a super-computer from stolen fairy technology. Called the \"C Cube\", it will render all existing human technology obsolete. He arranges a meeting with a powerful Chicago businessman, Jon Spiro, to broker a deal for the C Cube. But Spiro springs a trap, steals the C Cube, and mortally injures Butler. Artemis knows his only hope of saving his loyal bodyguard is to employ fairy magic; so once again, he must contact his old rival, Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon fairy police.</p> <p>It is going to take a miracle to save Butler, and Artemis's luck may just run out.</p>";
