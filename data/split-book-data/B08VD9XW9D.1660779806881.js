window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Degara Omiataâ€™s a thief. A scavenger. A disgraced pilot. She makes her living any way she can in the seething underbelly of Orlens on Gairue 2. When her high-ranking military brother, the crown jewel of the family, finds himself embroiled in a traitorous plot, Degara must accept one more assignment on behalf of the Terran government that ruined her. Track down the data that was sold and secreted off to the Rebellion. Degara is many things - jaded, reluctant, untrustworthy, black sheep of the family, and a total failure. But now? She has to become the thing she fears most. A hero.</p>";
