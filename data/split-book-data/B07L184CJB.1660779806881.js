window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A brilliantly written&nbsp;and&nbsp;riveting post-dystopian debut from Eyal Kless about a society hoping to salvage the technology of a lost generation, a mysterious missing boy who can open doors no one else can, and a scribe who must piece together the past to determine humanity’s future.</b></p> <p>More than 100 years have passed since the Catastrophe brought humanity to the brink of extinction. Those who survived are changed. The Wildeners have reverted to the old ways - but with new gods - while others place their faith in the technology that once powered their lost civilization.</p> <p>In the mysterious City of Towers, the center of the destroyed Tarakan empire, a lowly scribe of the Guild of Historians is charged with a dangerous assignment. He must venture into the wilds beyond the glass and steel towers to discover the fate of a child who mysteriously disappeared more than a decade before. Born of a rare breed of marked people, the child, Rafik - known as “The Key” - was one of a special few with the power to restore this lost civilization to glory once again.</p> <p>In a world riven by fear and violence, where tattooed mutants, manic truckers, warring guilds, and greedy mercenaries battle for survival, this one boy may have single-handedly destroyed humanity’s only chance for salvation - unless the scribe can figure out what happened to him.</p>";
