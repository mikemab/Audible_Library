The fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Technical Chief \"Pappy\" Gunther is a grizzled, burning out commando in the United Earth Armed Forces. He ponders a return to civilian life, yet feels a strong sense of belonging to his elite team. When colonists on a far-flung world request aid, a task force from several allied systems is assembled. Pappy and his crack unit are sent to investigate, and to engage a mysterious alien force from beyond.&nbsp;</p> <p>Talks-to-His-Spear is the warrior-caste champion of a matriarchal space empire called the Regime. Leading an army of fanatical, genetically enhanced super soldiers, he dreams of dying in battle for the glory of his queen. However, heâ€™s beginning to question the motives of this new campaign and fears that he may have to compromise his own deep sense of honor in order to fulfill his tasks.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nobody expected the two alien cultures to have so much in common and for friendships and alliances to form alongside rivalries. However, when Pappy discovers a rebellion spanning worlds, everything changes. The growing insurrection threatens to tear the Regime - and the galaxy - apart.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Don't miss the exciting start to a military sci-fi series from debut author Jonathan Hernandez.
