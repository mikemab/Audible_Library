window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>“What on earth would I gain from that?” I asked him.&nbsp;“Risk my own neck by violating my banishment just to leave you?&nbsp;The sentence placed on me if I return is execution. If I’m entering the mountains again, I’d damn well better get something out of it.”&nbsp;</i></p> <p>Exiled from the Silverwood and the people she loves, Mae has few illusions about ever returning to her home. But when she comes across three out-of-place strangers in her wanderings, she finds herself contemplating the unthinkable: risking death to help a deposed queen regain her throne.&nbsp;</p> <p>And if anyone can help Mona Alastaire of Lumen Lake, it is a former Woodwalker - a ranger whose very being is intimately tied to the woods they are sworn to protect. Mae was once one of the best, and despite the potential of every tree limb to become the gibbet she’s hung from, she not only feels a duty to aide Mona and her brothers, but also to walk beneath her beloved trees once more.&nbsp;</p> <p>A grand quest in the tradition of great epic fantasies, filled with adventure and the sharp wit - and tongue - of a unique hero, <i>Woodwalker </i>is the perfect novel to start your own journey into the realm of magical fiction.&nbsp;</p>";
