window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A blend of hard biomedical science fiction with multicultural fantasy, </b><b><i>Neodymium Exodus</i></b><b> combines the introspection of classics like </b><b><i>Perelandra </i></b><b>with the vibrant boldness of modern best sellers like </b><b><i>This Alien Shore</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Space Opera</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Lem’s a mace-wielding teen space-ninja in a universe of sentient insectoids, purple jungles, and insane electromagnetic fields. She solves most problems by hitting harder, and never plays by her enemy's rules - until Jared Diebol captures her.</p> <p>Diebol is the rising leader of an army uniting the galaxy by force. He believes that the violent energy being Njande has “contaminated” Lem and her friends from another dimension to conquer the matter-based universe. Diebol’s army usually kills contaminated people - but he vows to cure Lem.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Diebol kidnaps Lem’s family, he forces her to choose between the matter beings she loves and the energy person she adores. If Lem rejects Diebol’s cure, her family dies - but if Lem cuts out Njande’s energy, she opens our universe to a much darker thermodynamic attack.</p>";
