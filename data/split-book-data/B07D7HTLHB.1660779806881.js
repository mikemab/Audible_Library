window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An original dramatic presentation, cowritten by William Gibson, national best-selling author of </b><b><i>Neuromancer </i></b><b>and other classics, and Michael St. John Smith.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>The year is 2016. Not <i>our </i>2016. Theirs.&nbsp;Earth is dying, the result of a worldwide nuclear holocaust caused by America’s dictatorial President-for-Life Lewis Henderson, a man who will use any means necessary to maintain power and survive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Enter: The Splitter. A machine capable of splitting off an exact replica of Henderson’s world. A world where the cataclysmic events causing its destruction have yet to occur.&nbsp;</p> <p>That world is ours.&nbsp;</p> <p>In August of 1945, our postwar Europe becomes the battleground for Henderson’s operatives - led by his sociopathic son - as they engineer a complete redo of their history. By changing ours. Their mission is to take over our world and rule it absolutely - again.&nbsp;</p> <p>The only obstacles in their way are a disabled rebel colonel in an underground bunker; a Marine pilot who pursues Henderson’s men across time; and a British secret weapons analyst who must accept that the impossible is, in fact, possible.&nbsp;</p> <p>And that the fate of<i> two </i>worlds hangs in the balance.</p> <p>The cast of <i>Archangel</i> includes:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Neil Hellegers as PROF.
