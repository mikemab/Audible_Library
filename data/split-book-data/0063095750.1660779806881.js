window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An Indie Next Pick!</b></p> <p><b>From the number one best-selling author in Japan comes a celebration of books, cats, and the people who love them, infused with the heartwarming spirit of </b><b><i>The Guest Cat</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Travelling Cat Chronicles.</i></b></p> <p>Bookish high school student Rintaro Natsuki is about to close the secondhand bookstore he inherited from his beloved bookworm grandfather. Then, a talking cat appears with an unusual request. The feline asks for — or rather, demands — the teenager’s help in saving books with him. The world is full of lonely books left unread and unloved, and the cat and Rintaro must liberate them from their neglectful owners.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their mission sends this odd couple on an amazing journey, where they enter different mazes to set books free. Through their travels, the cat and Rintaro meet a man who leaves his books to perish on a bookshelf, an unwitting book torturer who cuts the pages of books into snippets to help people speed read, and a publishing drone who only wants to create best sellers. Their adventures culminate in one final, unforgettable challenge — the last maze that awaits leads Rintaro down a realm only the bravest dare enter....</p> <p>An enthralling tale of books, first love, fantasy, and an unusual friendship with a talking cat, <i>The Cat Who Saved Books </i>is a story for those for whom books are so much more than words on paper.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Translated from the Japanese by Louise Heal Kawai. </i></p> <p><b>\"Cats, books, young love, and adventure: catnip for a variety of readers!\" (</b><b><i>Kirkus)</i></b></p>";
