Or will another legend rise to take his place?</p> <p>Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile, has returned to the Core. Determined to bring peace back to mankind at the edge of his sword, he must overcome or unite the treacherous Gold families of the Core and face down Darrow over the skies of war-torn Mercury.&nbsp;</p> <p>But theirs are not the only fates hanging in the balance.</p> <p>On Luna, Mustang, Sovereign of the Republic, campaigns to unite the Republic behind her husband.
