window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Time-travel romance meets Tudor-era mayhem in<i> A Contemporary Asshat at the Court of Henry VIII</i>, the latest book from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author MaryJanice Davidson.&nbsp;</p> <p>American expat Joan Howe has a to-do list she loathes: find a new job, buy milk, ask her neurologist friend, Lisa, to cure her migraines. So when Lisa enrolls her in an experimental drug trial, Joan is elated. That is, until she takes the medication and wakes up at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. That's right, Joan wakes up smack-dab in the middle of the court of Henry VIII.&nbsp;</p> <p>After realizing this isn't the most elaborate Renaissance festival ever, Joan accidentally spills the beans on how England and France will soon be at war. In spite of her faux pas, Joan returns to present-day Wisconsin, where she's met by the scientists from a secret think tank who accidentally created the time-travel portals. What's worse? They can't control the portals and Joan is the only person who has been able to return.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well at least now she has a new job: time-traveler wrangler, and there's plenty of work rescuing those who go missing. Her to-do list is getting shorter every day. But all is not as it seems. Joan discovers a rogue think-tank employee caused the accident that created the portals and has remained in the past to wreak dastardly havoc on the timeline and alter history.&nbsp;</p> <p>With stunningly handsome courtier Thomas Wynter by her side and good old-fashioned 21st-century know-how, Joan races against time to catch a culprit bent on destroying history changing the world as they know it forever.</p>";
