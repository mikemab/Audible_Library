window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Over One Million Copies Sold</b></p> <p><b>Now an International Best Seller</b></p> <p><b>If you could go back, who would you want to meet? </b></p> <p>In a small back alley of Tokyo, there is a café that has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than 100 years. Local legend says that this shop offers something else besides coffee - the chance to travel back in time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of one summer, four customers visit the café in the hopes of making that journey. But time travel isn’t so simple, and there are rules that must be followed. Most important, the trip can last only as long as it takes for the coffee to get cold.&nbsp;</p> <p>Heartwarming, wistful, mysterious, and delightfully quirky, Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s internationally best-selling novel explores the age-old question: What would you change if you could travel back in time?</p>";
