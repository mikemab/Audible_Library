Clark, foggy with fever, makes a mistake that entangles the fates of an Italian hotelier and an African busboy. This sets off a cycle of unwitting retribution between&nbsp;three Zambian&nbsp;families (Black, White, Brown) as they collide and converge over the course of the century,&nbsp;into the present and beyond. As the generations pass, their lives - their triumphs, errors, losses and hopes - emerge through a panorama of history, fairy tale, romance, and science fiction.&nbsp;</p> <p>From a woman covered with hair and another plagued with endless tears, to forbidden love affairs and fiery political ones, to homegrown technological marvels like Afronauts, microdrones, and viral vaccines, this gripping, unforgettable novel is a testament to our yearning&nbsp;to create and cross&nbsp;borders, and a meditation on the&nbsp;slow, grand passage of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Shortlisted for the Arthur C.
