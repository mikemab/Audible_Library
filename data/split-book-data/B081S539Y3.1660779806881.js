window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Corporal&nbsp;David Cohen thought he’d left war behind.</b></p> <p><b>He was wrong.</b></p> <p>The Terran Coalition faces repeated and brutal attacks from the repressive League of Sol. To defend his home planet,&nbsp;David trades his dream of becoming a rabbi for a battlefront in the far reaches of space. When particle beams fly, his courage under fire brings quick promotion. But in the lulls between battles when he must confront his soul,&nbsp;David finds a different enemy: the ghosts of those killed under his command.</p> <p>Yet in war, it’s kill or be killed - and the enemy shows no mercy.</p> <p>David must square the tenets of his faith against his responsibility to crew and country. If he fails in his command, billions face enslavement by a ruthless regime. Now it’s an all-out fight for the galaxy’s freedom.</p> <p><b>Because a man’s greatest foe lies within.</b></p> <p>If you love <i>Babylon 5</i>,<i> Safehold</i>, and <i>Destroyermen</i>, you must listen to <i>Echoes of War</i>, a military sci-fi series that will take you to the heart of duty, sacrifice, and the unseen scars of those who serve.</p>";
