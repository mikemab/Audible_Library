Casualties grow on both sides as the conflict leaves no corner of the world untouched.</p> <p>Illarion Glaskov’s quiet life on the fringes of the empire is thrown into chaos when an impossible tragedy strikes his village. When he is conscripted into the Tsarist military, he is sent to serve in The Wall - an elite regiment that pilots suits of armor made from the husks of dead golems.</p> <p>But the great war is not the only - or even the worst - danger facing Illarion, as he is caught in a millennia-old conflict between two goddesses. He must survive the ravages of trench warfare, horrific monsters from another world, and the treacherous internal politics of the country he serves.</p> <p>At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).</p> <p>Larry Correia is the Dragon Award-winning, best-selling author of the Monster Hunter International series, the Saga of the Forgotten Warrior series, the Grimnoir Chronicles, and the Dead Six series of military thrillers.</p> <p>Steve Diamond founded and runs the review site Elitist Book Reviews, which was nominated for the Hugo Award in 2013, 2014, and 2015.
