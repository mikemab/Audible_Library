window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Witty and thought provoking, two Vatican astronomers shed provocative light on some of the strange places where religion and science meet. </p> <p>\"Imagine if a Martian showed up, all big ears and big nose like a child’s drawing, and he asked to be baptized. How would you react?\" - Pope Francis, May 2014. </p> <p>Pope Francis posed that question - without insisting on an answer! - to provoke deeper reflection about inclusiveness and diversity in the Church. But it's not the first time that question has been asked. </p> <p>Brother Guy Consolmagno and Father Paul Mueller hear questions like that all the time. They’re scientists at the Vatican Observatory, the official astronomical research institute of the Catholic Church. In <i>Would You Baptize an Extraterrestrial</i>? they explore a variety of questions at the crossroads of faith and reason: How do you reconcile the The Big Bang with Genesis? Was the Star of Bethlehem just a pious religious story or an actual description of astronomical events? What really went down between Galileo and the Catholic Church - and why do the effects of that confrontation still reverberate to this day? Will the Universe come to an end? And - could you really baptize an extraterrestrial? </p> <p>With disarming humor, Brother Guy and Father Paul explore these questions and more over the course of six days of dialogue. <i>Would You Baptize an Extraterrestrial</i> will make you laugh, make you think, and make you reflect more deeply on science, faith, and the nature of the universe.</p>";
