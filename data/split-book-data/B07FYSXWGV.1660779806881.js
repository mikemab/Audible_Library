His phone, his money, and his identity are all useless and he quickly finds that he is foreign and alone in his own country.&nbsp;</p> <p>Matt must meet the challenge to survive in a newly forming society where he seemingly has no relevant skills and no one he can count on. He suspects that his 21st century knowledge of science and technology could make him a king in the New World, but he quickly finds that 18th-century America is a dynamic place where nothing is guaranteed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The challenge to prosper, succeed and especially to win the hand of a beautiful Virginia farm girl is like nothing he has ever faced.</p>";
