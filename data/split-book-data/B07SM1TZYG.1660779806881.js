window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alexander Grant is a little too good at a few too many things. Two dozen martial arts. Twice that many languages. Chess, the piano, sports, forging excused absences, you name it. He graduated high school top of his class...seventeen times. Of course, no one knows any of this. Not that he wants to go unnoticed. Itâ€™s just safer that way. So for the last several decades, Alexander has been forced to move from town to small town to even smaller town - he just bought his 651st house - in an effort to live a painfully quiet life. But when a mysterious cabal attempts to kidnap him and kill his friends, Alexander must use all his skills and centuries of training to outwit the most dangerous man alive, the mastermind of a plot that would change the world forever.</p> <p>Clever, intriguing, skillfully woven with humor, <i>Alexander X</i> launches us on an epic journey toward a future few of us will survive, rising from a past we never knew existed.</p>";
