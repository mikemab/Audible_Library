Like Mia, Grans has witchcraft running through her veins, and life with her is never boring. Plus, the cause is a good one - helping Grans get the local food bank up and running again. But there's an unappetizing surprise in store. While Mia is knee-deep in boxes of donated produce, she encounters the body of Dorian Alexander.</p> <p>Dorian was a warlock, leader of the local coven. He was also her Grans' new beau. There's no potion that'll make this trouble disappear. But if Mia wants to keep her Grans - now a prime suspect - from serving a spell in prison, she'll have to unearth the real killer fast....</p>";
