window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Time travel, murder, corruption, restless baby dinosaurs, and a snarky robot named Ruby collide in this excellent, noir-inflected, humor-infused, science-fiction thriller.”—</b><b><i>The Boston Globe</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>An impossible crime. A detective on the edge of madness. The future of time travel at stake. From the author&nbsp;of </b><b><i>The Warehouse</i></b><b> . . .</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>January Cole’s job just got a whole lot harder.</p> <p>Not that running security at the Paradox was ever really easy. Nothing’s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their “flights” to the past.</p> <p>Or where proximity to the timeport makes the clocks run backward on occasion—and, rumor has it, allows ghosts to stroll the halls.</p> <p>None of that compares to the corpse in room 526. The one that seems to be both there and not there. The one that somehow only January can see.</p> <p>On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked in.&nbsp;Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology—and the world’s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims.</p> <p>January is sure the timing isn’t a coincidence. Neither are those “accidents” that start stalking their bidders.</p> <p>There’s a reason January can glimpse what others can’t. A reason why she’s the only one who can catch a killer who’s operating invisibly and in plain sight, all at once.</p> <p>But her ability is also destroying her grip on reality—and as her past, present, and future collide, she finds herself confronting not just the hotel’s dark secrets but her own.</p> <p>At once a dazzlingly time-twisting murder mystery and a story about grief, memory, and what it means to—literally—come face-to-face with our ghosts, <i>The Paradox Hotel</i> is another unforgettable speculative thrill ride from acclaimed author Rob Hart.</p>";
