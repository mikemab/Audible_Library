But she is young, untested in battle, and often led by her rash temper. In the complex world of Lenayin loyalties, her willfulness is attracting the wrong kind of attention. </p> <p>Lenin is a land divided by its beliefs: the Verenthane of the ruling class, and the pagan Goeren-yai, amongst whom Sasha now lives. The Goeren-yai value swordplay and honor, and have come to see Sasha as the great spirit who will unite them. But Sasha is still searching for what she believes and must choose her side carefully. </p> <p>Soon she will face her moment of testing. Is she ready to lead? Can she be the savior the Goeren-yai want her to be? </p>";
