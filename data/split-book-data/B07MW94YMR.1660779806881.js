window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Human-explored space lies between two alien races that are either openly aggressive or covertly hostile. 7th Fleet discovers that one of those races is moving to attack. In a moment of panic, the commanding admiral orders the fleet to attempt a risky jump through hyperspace. They miss hitting their target star’s gravity well and end up deep in unexplored space with a shockingly long trip home and not nearly enough food to last that long. With war now raging in their home systems, the officers of 7th Fleet must find a way to put aside their egos, ambitions, and fears in order to make it back, and they know that not all of them will.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Scimitar’s Glory </i>is the first book in a new, fast-paced, action-packed military SF series: Swordships Odyssey. The second book, <i>Excalibur's Quest</i>, is also now available.</p>";
