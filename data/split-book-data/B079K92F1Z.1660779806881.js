window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Carter Morrison didn't want to kill his friends or himself, but he had a good reason. It was them or the end of all life on the planet. Their sacrifice saved the world. Not that anyone knew it. Until Katherine Manners stumbled over a melting man in a computer room clutching a message of doom from another world. </p> <p>Follow Carter Morrison; Catherine Manners; Elandine, the Queen of Hazurrium; and Jason Cole - also known as the Betrayer - as they try to understand, survive, save, and, in Jason's case, break free of the fictional worlds that insulate Earth from the dangers of the Strange, where world-eating monstrosities called planetovores lurk. </p>";
