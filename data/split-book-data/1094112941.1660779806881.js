window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An insidious cabal has decided to change the direction of the United Alliance of Stars (UAS) with a coup d’etat - but not through a military takeover. They have devised a subtler coup: the manipulation of the Committee, the 15-star system that sets policy for the UAS.&nbsp;</p> <p>This group of terrorists, calling itself WEP - for “We the People” - have issued an ultimatum: revise the UAS Constitution, or they will kill those who oppose the change. And good to their word, shortly afterward, Committee delegates are being killed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The UAS Committee enlists their de facto troubleshooter, Anna Paulus, to shut down the cabal, but they insists she leave the NIA and manage UAS Committee Security. For Anna it’s a nightmare scenario, leaving her safe and comfortable world for a completely new environment dominated by macho men with years of combat experience. Adding to her concerns, she can imagine herself WEP’s prime target.&nbsp;</p> <p>Anna soon realizes that things are not what they seem, and the cabal is quick to recognize her involvement as a potential problem. To make matters worse, the cabal is only months from succeeding - and only Anna and her red-headed krait stand in their way.</p>";
