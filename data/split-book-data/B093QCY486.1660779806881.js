window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>365 days and nights - one full Earth year - of total dark and killing cold? No human, ever, can live through it. None has tried since humans arrived on Storn.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tended by servos, they enter ancient cryostasis in tubes they know are beginning to fail. Until, that is, in the 357th year, desperate people known as The Group refuse to freeze in tubes. Instead, they will risk freezing on Storn's brutal surface because there are children who, if not taken to safety, will be the last of the new evolution. The last of the first true humans on Storn.&nbsp;</p> <p>But... Refuge, which they build in secret far from Complex and Settlements where the others will sleep the Winteryear away, may not be sufficient. Despite the perils, they act. Ansel, Trinto, Doncer, and others know only that there’s no choice. They must face temperatures below comprehension, blizzards and winds beyond imagination. They must stride into the unknown because if they don’t find a way to adapt to their planet, human life on Storn will cease to exist.</p>";
