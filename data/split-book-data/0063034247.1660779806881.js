window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The lovably flawed crew of </b><b><i>La Sirena Negra</i></b><b> and their psychic cats return in this fast-paced and outrageously fun science fiction novel, in which they confront past failures and face new threats in the far reaches of space from the author of the critically acclaimed </b><b><i>Chilling Effect</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Captain Eva Innocente and the crew of <i>La Sirena Negra</i> find themselves once again on the fringe of populated space - and at the center of a raging covert war. When Eva's sister asks for help locating a missing scientist, promises of a big paycheck and a noble cause convince Eva to take the job despite lingering trust issues.&nbsp;</p> <p>With reluctant assistance from her estranged mother, Eva and her crew follow the missing scientist's trail across the universe, from the costume-filled halls of a never-ending convention to a dangerous bot-fighting arena. They ultimately find themselves at the last place Eva wants to see again - Garilia - where she experienced her most shameful and haunting failure. To complete her mission and get paid, Eva must navigate a paradise embroiled in a rebellion, where massive forests and pristine beaches hide psychic creatures and pervasive surveillance technology. Can she find her quarry while avoiding the oppressive local regime, or will she be doomed to repeat past mistakes when her dark deeds come to light?&nbsp;</p>";
