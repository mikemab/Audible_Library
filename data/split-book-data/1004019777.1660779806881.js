window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Expanse</i> meets <i>Altered Carbon</i> in this breakneck science-fiction thriller where immortality is theoretically achievable, yet identity, gender and selfhood are very much in jeopardy....</p> <p>Carter Langston is murdered whilst salvaging a derelict vessel - a major inconvenience as he's downloaded into a brand new body on the space station where he backed up, several weeks' journey away. But events quickly slip out of control when an assassin breaks into the medbay and tries to finish the job.&nbsp;</p> <p>Death no longer holds sway over a humanity that has spread across the solar system: consciousness can be placed in a new body, or coil, straight after death, giving people the potential for immortality. Yet Carter's backups - supposedly secure - have been damaged, his crew are missing and everything points back to the derelict that should have been a simple salvage mission. With enemies in hot pursuit, Carter tracks down his last crewmate - re-coiled after death into a body she cannot stand - to delve deeper into a mystery that threatens humanity and identity as they have come to know it.</p>";
