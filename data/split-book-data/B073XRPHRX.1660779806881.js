window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Empires of EVE: A History of the Great Wars of EVE Online</i> is the incredible true story of the dictators and governments that have risen to power within the real virtual world of EVE Online. </p> <p>Since 2003, this sci-fi virtual world has been ruled by player-led governments commanding tens of thousands of real people. The conflict and struggle for power between these diverse governments has led to wars, espionage, and battles fought by thousands of people from nations all over the world. There have been climactic last stands, wars for honor and revenge, and spies who caused more damage than a fleet of warships. </p> <p>Empires of EVE is the history of how political ideas first began to take hold in EVE Online, how that led to the creation of the first governments and political icons, and how those governments eventually collapsed into a state of total war from 2007-2009. </p>";
