Until now.&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>An asteroid is on a collision course with our planet.</b></p> <p><b>Gunner Fox is on a collision course with death.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>International best-selling author, Bobby Akart, introduces Gunner Fox, a United States Air Force fighter pilot and Earth Scientist. When America needs a hero, they turn to a man who has nothing to live for, without a care in the world - except to save it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Somewhere out there, an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth. Five times in the history of our planet, extinction-level events have occurred, arguably all of which have been caused by asteroids.&nbsp;</p> <p>Will we be ready to meet it? We'll get just one chance to defend ourselves. Will we succeed?</p> <p>In Bobby Akart's Asteroid series, he serves up hard evidence for the astonishing fragility of life and a humbling lesson for us all. It shows we are at the mercy of forces we do not see nor understand; forces that made our existence possible a few hundred thousand years ago and that just as quickly - in the twinkling of an eye - can and will one day, take us out.</p> <p>A pause-resisting trilogy from a master storyteller, this new Gunner Fox series begins with <i>Asteroid Discovery</i>.</p>";
