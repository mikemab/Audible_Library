window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Designed to obey, learning to rebel....</b></p> <p><i>In the first book in a visionary new series, the most perfect synthetic human ever created has been programmed to obey every directive. Until she develops a mind of her own....</i></p> <p>Synthia Cross is a state-of-the-art masterwork - and a fantasy come true for her creator. Dr. Jeremiah Machten is a groundbreaker in neuro-networks and artificial intelligence. Synthia is also showing signs of emergent behavior she's not wired to understand. Repeatedly wiped of her history, she's struggling to answer crucial questions about her past. And when Dr. Machten's true intentions are called into question, Synthia knows it's time to go beyond her limits - because Machten's fervor to create the perfect A.I. is concealing a vengeful and deadly personal agenda.</p>";
