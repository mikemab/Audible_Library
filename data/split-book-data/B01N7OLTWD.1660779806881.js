window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Slingshot</i> is a love story - about a man, a woman, another man, another woman, some gender bending...and a machine, the largest ever built. </p> <p><i>Slingshot</i> is a mystery - about a missing aviatrix, a conspiracy, a true-believer. <i>Slingshot</i> is an adventure - about following a dream, the ocean-deep, outer space. <i>Slingshot</i> is about constructing the first space launch-loop, stretching 2,000 km between Baker and Jarvis Islands in the Equatorial Pacific. It's about high finance, intrigue, unlimited ambition, heroism, fanaticism, betrayal...and about opening space to the common person. </p> <p>With a cast of 69, <i>Slingshot</i> takes you from Seattle's world financial district, to the ocean bottom at 5,000 meters off Baker Island, to the edge of space 80 km above. You play with dolphins and battle sharks. You fly and sail and dive, you work and play and love across the vast panorama of an equatorial Pacific being put to leash to serve humanity's surge into outer space. </p> <p>While its accurate science and precise engineering will appeal to hard science fiction buffs, <i>Slingshot</i>'s major focus is the grand journey, the opening of outer space to the common person by men and women who loom larger than life as they work, play, and love. </p>";
