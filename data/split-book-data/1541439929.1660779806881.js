window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The human race is running out of time on overcrowded Earth, and only one man has the courage to do what is necessary to save it. Colony ship <i>Ark </i>is the greatest project the human race will ever attempt, a self-contained world 100 years in the building, launched on a 10,000-year voyage to carry the seeds of civilization to the stars. It is humanity's final gamble for escape from a desperate world, but the price of hope is measured in lives.</p> <p>Joshua Crewe, <i>Ark</i>'s designer. Obsessed with his vision, he's devoted his life to winning the power to turn it into reality. No burden is too great to bear in pursuit of his dream - especially when other people are the ones to bear it.</p> <p>Aurora Brady, first of the space-born, with one foot in the future and one in the past. She must give power to her enemies to see <i>Ark</i> launched, but giving too much will mean its destruction.</p> <p>Jedidiah Fourgere, a simple farm boy. He finds himself caught up in a revolution that will forever change the balance of power in <i>Ark</i>'s hermetically sealed world. Torn between love and faith, humanity's future lies in his hands.</p>";
