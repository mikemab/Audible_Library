They've joined the pirates they once hunted and are prepared to leave Wefrivain in quest for a new life. However, an unexpected cry for help brings them unwillingly back into home waters.</p> <p>The fauns of Maijha Minor are in trouble, and helping them seems like the right thing to do. To succeed, they must circulate Gwain's forbidden book, which tells the truth about the wyvern gods. Gwain himself has already given up the task as hopeless, but Silveo has other ideas. Together, they will get into more trouble than anyone thought possible.</p> <p>Note: This book was originally published as Books 4-5 of the Cowry Catchers series. This new edition includes bonus stories that were originally sold separately.</p>";
