window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This is the history of how the City was saved, by Notker the professional liar, written down because eventually the truth always seeps through. </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The City may be under siege, but everyone still has to make a living. Take Notker, the acclaimed playwright, actor, and impresario. Nobody works harder, even when he's not working. Thankfully, it turns out that people enjoy the theater just as much when there are big rocks falling out of the sky.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Notker is a man of many talents, and all the world is, apparently, a stage. It seems that the empire needs him - or someone who looks a lot like him - for a role that will call for the performance of a lifetime. At least it will guarantee fame, fortune, and immortality. If it doesn't kill him first.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>In the follow up to the acclaimed </b><b><i>Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City</i></b><b>, K. J.
