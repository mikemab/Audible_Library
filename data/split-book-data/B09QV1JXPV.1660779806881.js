window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Serevak, ritual sacrifice, slavery, torture, and genocide are polite conversation. The concept of good triumphing over evil disappeared when the benevolent King Reinhardt Embersoul was killed in a coup. But hope isn't dead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alenikka, the heir apparent to her father's stolen throne, doesn't want the responsibility.&nbsp;She just wants to find her sisters so they can live their lives far away in peace. But when her contacts inside the usurper's castle inform her that her sisters are being hunted, they convince her to take on the unlikeliest of allies - the enemy's General, Magnus. General Magnus finds out the consequences of loyalty and honor, and for all his years of service, his price has been named - his daughter. Her life, along with nine others will feed the soul of the Dragon God.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of his oldest friend, the castle mage Torzod, a gnome with a penchant for women and a temper as explosive as his arsenal, a dragon-slaying witch defected from a long-dead enemy, and the millenias-old colossi hunters, he must defeat an ancient lich before the ritual is complete.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every thousand years, Alewurm of the clan Seaghach must travel to the demon-infested continent of Eikrios to assemble the clans to fend off entities the size of cities. This time, his trip is interrupted when he is possessed by the soul of the Dragon God's first, and he slays the Eikriotian warlord. Hunted by those he once considered allies, he must rid himself of his possessor and gather the clans before time runs out and the colossi destroy the world.</p>";
