This wasn't the end, though, as a deity chose me to save another world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I woke up in the body of Kupiec Aiden, in a world where magic was real.

His family took me in, and I recovered from his sickness before learning about magic, or Aether as they called it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I discovered that I had immense innate talent in Aether Gathering, and was offered a scholarship to attend Azyl Academy, the city's premier institution. Where do I fit in this world, and how am I going to be key to saving it?</p>";
