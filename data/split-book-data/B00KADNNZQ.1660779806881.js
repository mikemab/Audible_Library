His presence was tolerated and accepted but not welcomed. Little did he know how much his life would change that day. How could one large stone make such a difference in one's world? Renamaum, was a large blue dragon with one desire. He wanted the pact between man and dragon re-established. He wanted the hunting of the eggs and fledglings to stop. He had stood before the council and demanded they help him find a dragonsworn to protect the fledglings of both races rather then go to war. Little did he know how abruptly his plans would stop. He did not foresee the one small outcast that would pick up his banner, a geas so strong that neither could abandon it, even in death.</p>";
