Instead of angels, pearly gates, and eternal rewards, a voice in her head keeps telling her that she’s become a dungeon core, whatever that is.</p> <p>Now people keep coming into her new home, wrecking stuff, and stealing from her. But not everything about this whole ordeal is bad. Not only can Florence decorate her home with a thought, but she can also create the best things in the entire universe — she can create kitty cats.</p> <p>Should these hooligans keep insisting on coming into her home, well, Florence and her kitties are going to have something to say about that.</p>";
