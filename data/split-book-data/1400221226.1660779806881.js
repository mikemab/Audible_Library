window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Who better to face the greatest evil of the 20th century than a humble man of faith?</b></p> <p>As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer - a pastor and author, known as much for such spiritual classics as <i>The Cost of Discipleship </i>and <i>Life Together</i> as for his 1945 execution in a concentration camp for his part in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.</p> <p>In the first major biography of Bonhoeffer in 40 years, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life - the theologian and the spy - to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil. In a deeply moving narrative, Metaxas uses previously unavailable documents - including personal letters, detailed journal entries, and firsthand personal accounts - to reveal dimensions of Bonhoeffer's life and theology never before seen.</p> <p>In <i>Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet,&nbsp;Spy</i>, Metaxas presents the fullest accounting of Bonhoeffer's heart-wrenching 1939 decision to leave the safe haven of America for Hitler's Germany, and using extended excerpts from love letters and coded messages written to and from Bonhoeffer's Cell 92, Metaxas tells for the first time the full story of Bonhoeffer's passionate and tragic romance.</p> <p>Listeners will discover fresh insights and revelations about his life-changing months at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and about his radical position on why Christians are obliged to stand up for the Jews. Metaxas also sheds new light on Bonhoeffer's reaction to Kristallnacht and his involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in \"Operation 7\", the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland.</p> <p><i>Bonhoeffer</i> gives witness to one man's extraordinary faith and to the tortured fate of the nation he sought to deliver from the curse of Nazism. It brings the listener face to face with a man determined to do the will of God radically, courageously, and joyfully - even to the point of death. <i>Bonhoeffer</i> is the story of a life framed by a passion for truth and a commitment to justice on behalf of those who face implacable evil.</p> <p>\"Insightful and illuminating, this tome makes a powerful contribution to biography, history and theology.\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)</p> <p>\"[A] massive and masterful new biography.\" (<i>Christianity Today</i>)</p> <p>\"Metaxas tells Bonhoeffer's story with passion and theological sophistication.\" (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)</p> <p>\"Metaxas magnificently captures the life of theologian and anti-Nazi activist Dietrich Bonhoeffer.... A definitive Bonhoeffer biography for the 21st Century.\" (<i>Kirkus</i>)</p>";
