window.bookSummaryJSON = "In a world of sea monsters, mermaids and lost islands, ghost ships, leviathans and weather witches, only the impetuous, the brave or the mad seek adventure at sea. <p>After generations of friction, the leaders of two lands meet in the holy city of Ishalem to bring an end to the bloodshed and to divide the world between them.</p> <p>Sadly, this new spirit of fellowship is shortlived. A single tragic accident destroys, in minutes, the peace that took years to build. The world is once more cast into the fires of war - and this time the flames may burn until nothing remains. From the highest lord to the lowest servant, no man or woman will be unchanged by the conflict.</p> <p>But while war rages across both continents, a great quest will defy storms and sea serpents to venture beyond the horizon, where no maps exist - to search for a land out of legend. It is a perilous undertaking, but there will always be the impetuous, the brave and the mad who are willing to leave their homes to explore the unknown.</p> <p>Even unto the edge of the world . . .</p>";
