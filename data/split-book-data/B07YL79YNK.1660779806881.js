window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No alien menace is too menacing, no galactic rift too rifty for the multiverse’s most-trusted Interdimensional Insurance Agent in these three brand-new adventures and two classic escapades.</p> <p>Whether he’s underwriting for an overlord, or wearing a pocket protector in a pocket universe, Tom Stranger has just one policy: providing Quality Customer Service. With his trusty Combat Wombat at his side, and the world’s worst intern in his way, Tom vows to Insure and Protect. And nothing—not an invading skeleton army nor evil dolphin kidnappers nor misplacing his favorite bowtie—will stop him from kicking ass and adjusting claims.</p> <p>Written by Audible number-one sci-fi and fantasy bestseller Larry Correia, and featuring the narrative stylings of Adam Baldwin, <i>#1 in Customer Service: The Complete Adventures of Tom Stranger</i> includes:</p> <p><b>New in ths audio:</b></p> <p><b>\"Doughnut Run\"</b><br> Jimmy the Intern hands out doughnuts to the staff, and stumbles on an insidious conspiracy. Chaos and a perilous lack of glazeds ensues.</p> <p><b>\"Apocalypse Cow\"</b> <br> The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse walk into a Waffle House. Tom and Jimmy walk out. Civilizations across the multiverse threaten to collapse. Perhaps Jimmy should have stayed to finish his breakfast.</p> <p><b>\"The Custies\"</b><br> Will Stranger &amp; Stranger be named Number One in Customer Service for the fourth year running?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Also included in this audio:</b></p> <p><b>\"The Adventures of Tom Stranger, Interdimensional Insurance Agent\"</b><br> Tom must uphold the reputation of Stranger &amp; Stranger Insurance, all while battling tentacle monsters, legions of the damned, an evil call center in Nebraska, and his arch-nemesis, Jeff Conundrum.</p> <p><b>\"A Murder of Manatees\"</b><br> The beloved Wendell the Manatee is kidnapped. Armed with his battle mechs and his elite corps of junior associates, can Tom find Wendell before he's canned in oil? And can Jimmy the Intern channel his inner agent?&nbsp;</p>";
