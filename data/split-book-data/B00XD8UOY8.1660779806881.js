window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>\"We speak of a mother's love, but we forget her power.\"</i> </p><p>Civilization has come to the alien, sunless planet its inhabitants call Eden. </p><p>Just a few generations ago, the planet's 500 inhabitants huddled together in the light and warmth of the Forest's lantern trees, afraid to venture out into the cold darkness around them. </p><p>Now, humanity has spread across Eden, and two kingdoms have emerged. Both are sustained by violence and dominated by men - and both claim to be the favored children of Gela, the woman who came to Eden long ago on a boat that could cross the stars, and became the mother of them all. </p><p>When young Starlight Brooking meets a handsome and powerful man from across Worldpool, she believes he will offer an outlet for her ambition and energy. But she has no inkling that she will become a stand-in for Gela herself, and wear Gela's fabled ring on her own finger - or that in this role, powerful and powerless all at once, she will try to change the course of Eden's history. </p><p>Read by: </p><p>Jayne Entwistle <br>Bruce Mann <br>Heather Wilds <br>Suzan Crowley <br>Nicholas Guy Smith <br>Lucy Rayner <br>Hannah Curtis <br>Katharine McEwan <br>Emma Bering </p>";
