window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Harmon Tomeral, along with his friends and allies, continues to develop the forces of Salvage System, for its own defense and - if the cause is just - to defend others. Humans and aliens working together would seem novel...but then again, outside of Earth and the Sol System, humans are aliens, too.&nbsp;</p> <p>Having salvaged, repaired, and rebuilt a number of warships, the Salvage Fleet is a presence to be reckoned with. The Ground Force, including its specialty unit, the Bolts, has also continued to grow, and they spend their time training with the weapons of war - mechs, tanks, artillery, and battle armor - and anything else they can get their hands and paws on that will give them an edge in battle.</p> <p>When the Nazrooth System calls, they are once again compelled to right a wrong. It won’t be easy...but then again, it never is. Just don’t tell Harmon the odds - he doesn’t want to know them. Despite a staggering imbalance in forces, Harmon boards his flagship, Salvage Title, and leads the majority of his fleet to free Nazrooth. Only a small, defensive fleet is left behind, full of trainees and reservists.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both Salvage Fleet and the home forces are ready to face the odds, but what if this time they’re insurmountable?</p>";
