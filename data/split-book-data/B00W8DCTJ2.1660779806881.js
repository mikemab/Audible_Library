Clarke Award 2016.</b> </p> <p><b>Longlisted for the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction, 2016. </b></p> <p><i>Firefly</i> meets <i>Mass Effect</i> in this thrilling self-published debut! </p> <p>When Rosemary Harper joins the crew of the <i>Wayfarer</i>, she isn't expecting much. The <i>Wayfarer</i>, a patched-up ship that's seen better days, offers her everything she could possibly want: a small, quiet spot to call home for a while, adventure in far-off corners of the galaxy, and distance from her troubled past. </p> <p>But Rosemary gets more than she bargained for with the <i>Wayfarer</i>. The crew is a mishmash of species and personalities, from Sissix, the friendly reptillian pilot, to Kizzy and Jenks, the constantly sparring engineers who keep the ship running. Life onboard is chaotic but more or less peaceful - exactly what Rosemary wants. </p> <p>Until the crew are offered the job of a lifetime: the chance to build a hyperspace tunnel to a distant planet. They'll earn enough money to live comfortably for years...if they survive the long trip through war-torn interstellar space without endangering any of the fragile alliances that keep the galaxy peaceful. But Rosemary isn't the only person onboard with secrets to hide, and the crew will soon discover that space may be vast, but spaceships are very small indeed. </p>";
