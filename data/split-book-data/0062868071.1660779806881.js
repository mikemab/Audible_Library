window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The creator of the wildly popular award-winning podcast </b><b><i>Hardcore History</i></b><b> looks at some of the apocalyptic moments from the past as a way to frame the challenges of the future.</b></p> <p>Do tough times create tougher people? Can humanity handle the power of its weapons without destroying itself? Will human technology or capabilities ever peak or regress? No one knows the answers to such questions, but no one asks them in a more interesting way than Dan Carlin.</p> <p>In <i>The End Is Always Near</i>, Dan Carlin looks at questions and historical events that force us to consider what sounds like fantasy; that we might suffer the same fate that all previous eras did. Will our world ever become a ruin for future archaeologists to dig up and explore? The questions themselves are both philosophical and like something out of <i>The Twilight Zone</i>.</p> <p>Combining his trademark mix of storytelling, history, and weirdness, Dan Carlin connects the past and future in fascinating and colorful ways. At the same time the questions he asks us to consider involve the most important issue imaginable: human survival. From the collapse of the Bronze Age to the challenges of the nuclear era the issue has hung over humanity like a persistent Sword of Damocles.</p> <p>Inspired by his podcast,&nbsp;<i>The End Is Always Near</i>&nbsp;challenges the way we look at the past and ourselves. In this absorbing compendium, Carlin embarks on a whole new set of stories and major cliffhangers that will keep listeners enthralled. Idiosyncratic and erudite, offbeat yet profound,&nbsp;<i>The End Is Always Near</i>&nbsp;examines issues that are rarely presented, and makes the past immediately relevant to our very turbulent present.</p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
