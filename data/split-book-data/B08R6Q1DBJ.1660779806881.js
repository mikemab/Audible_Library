window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nearly a century has passed since the world was devastated by pandemics and wars that wiped out over 90 percent of the Earth’s population. To assure the survival of mankind, the leaders of the rebuilt city of Haven are breeding a better human race: meaning those deemed too stupid, too weak, too poor - too “unfit” - are arrested and forcibly sterilized.&nbsp;</p> <p>John Hunter is a penniless, self-educated young man from the wrong side of Haven struggling to make something of himself to provide for his wife and their hopes of starting a family. Until the authorities show up at his door and arrest him for the crime of being “unfit”. Heartbroken and humiliated, will John abandon his aspirations and resign himself to quietly accept his fate?</p>";
