window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A powerful century-old soldier returns to Earth from the Otherworld and attempts to reclaim his former life in this thrilling fantasy novel.</b></p> <p>For 130 years, Kreig Wiedermann has fought: first, as a teenage recruit for the Holy Order; then, as a soldier for the Empire; and most recently, as an immortal godlike warrior devoted only to avenging himself. The lust of combat is all he knows—until a portal opens on the battlefield and brings him back to the world from which he came.</p> <p>Despite the decades Kreig has survived in the Otherworld, only ten short years have passed on Earth, which means the life he considered lost forever might still be waiting for him. But rejoining humankind won’t be easy.</p> <p>For one thing, the International Otherworld Combat and Research Organization isn’t about to let a monstrous stranger with an unfathomably high level just wander around without first making sure he won’t wreak havoc on the planet. For another, Kreig has been tortured, imprisoned, betrayed, and hunted for years; he’s got his own demons to confront before he can reunite with his family and take up a normal life.</p> <p>Plus, there’s the little problem that not everyone thinks Kreig should be allowed to even dream of rehabilitation. And no matter how much he tries to leave his past behind, there are forces threatening to drag him back into his bloody legacy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p>A bold and clever twist on a classic isekai tale, <i>Returning to No Applause, Only More of the Same</i> is a dramatic, character-driven fantasy that proves the old adage “There’s no place like home.”</p> <p><b>The hit LitRPG fantasy—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Audible!</b></p>";
