window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Comet!</i> is the fifth in a series of near future sci-fi/thrillers whose young heroine Ell Donsaii has a nerve mutation which has rendered her a genius and an athletic phenomenon. In <i>Comet!</i>, she and her team begin exploring outer space using the wormholes she produced in <i>Rocket</i>. Unfortunately, Comet Hearth-Daster is on a trajectory to strike the Earth. Though it is smaller than the object that wiped out the dinosaurs, it still weighs 300 million metric tons and if it hits, it will wipe out civilization and may render the human race extinct.</p>";
