The novel combines multiple fictional and nonfictional genres into what some now call \"transhumanism\".</p> <p>This sci-fi/fantasy (cyberpunk) novel might best be described as Isaac Asimov meets J.R.R. Tolkien meets C.S. Lewis meets Ayn Rand meets William Gibson on steroids. It comprises multiple sub-narratives folded into a matrixed super-narrative, with plots, actions, characters, and agendas threaded throughout.</p> <p>Or, in a word, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tether-Diatraecus-Phete-Mcbawltalms/dp/1257063103/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1579753183&amp;refinements=p_27%3APhete+Mcbawltalms&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;text=Phete+Mcbawltalms\"><i>Diatraecus </i></a>is simply \"transcendent\".</p>";
