window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains books one and two of the humorous sci-fi</b> <b>Jane Bond series. </b></p> <p><i>Some Assembly Required</i>, book one&nbsp;</p> <p>An alien pilot. A chocolate cake. A doomed relationship or two.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jane’s life as an elementary school librarian gets sidetracked when she digs up the AI pilot of a 140-million-year-old spacecraft. Now, she’s running all over the world looking for spaceship parts, falling in and out of love, and trying to keep her friends from thinking she’s crazy. To make matters worse, the ship she’s recovering is starting to sound a bit more like the Death Star than the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>. When did life get so complicated?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, book two&nbsp;</p> <p>Fully stocked spaceship garage - check. Fully prepped spaceship - check. Fully trained...and ready to pilot? Jane’s got her own spaceship, but she has no idea how to even get it out of the garage, let alone fly it. No worries, everything’s under control - meet Olive, Jane’s new pilot!&nbsp;</p> <p>Jane finds some very interesting things in the basement left behind when Kit went away. Among them is a fully operational space ship. After an almost shattering start, Jane and her friends are globetrotting again, with the addition of Olive to pilot the ship - and make pancakes. Olive isn’t a real person, but she’s working hard at becoming one - and learning how to make pancakes and waffles along the way. But will pancakes be enough to deal with Jane’s mom <i>and</i> whatever lies on the dark side of the moon?</p>";
