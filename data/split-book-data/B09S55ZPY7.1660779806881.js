window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The tyranny of the gods is absolute, and they are capricious, malevolent and almost all-powerful, playing cruel games with the fates of mortals for their own ends....</p> <p>A vibrant and powerful epic set against an alternate Bronze Age, this tale of gods, men and monsters, conspiracy and war, is a rich, compelling and original tale from a master of the historical and fantasy genres. The people caught up in toils of the gods are merely trying to survive. Victims of vicious whims, trapped by their circumstances or pushed beyond what the mortal frame can bear, a handful of god-touched mortalsâ€”a scribe, a warlord, a dancer and a child - are about to be brought together in a conspiracy of their own.</p> <p>A conspiracy to reach the heavens and take down the corrupt and ageing gods...who are already facing troubles of their own....</p> <p>An epic that draws on the Greek mythology of gods and heroes, this new trilogy is a must-hear for fans of Dan Simmons and Madeline Miller alike.&nbsp;</p>";
