window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A journey to a faraway world… <br>With mankind on the brink of economic collapse, a population growing at an unmanageable rate and a limited supply of natural resources, there is only one place we can look to for our future… the stars. A deep space mining tug is sent to HD 85512 B, an Earth-like planet codenamed New Dawn, to begin a mission that will eventually see the relocation of humanity. </p> <p>…but will they survive? <br> As the deep space mining tug Athena heads to New Dawn, a crewmember dies unexpectedly. Geologist Jake Brooks must keep his wits about him to uncover what really happened—but are the confines of the ship clouding his judgement? Is there really a sinister motive behind the death, or is he letting his mind get the better of him? He must push on to reveal the truth, no matter who or what stands in his way… </p><p>Please note: New Dawn is not a hard sci-fi novel. </p>";
