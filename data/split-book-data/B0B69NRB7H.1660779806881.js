window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Discover the class you were born to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Wren, a seasoned healer, is dismayed when Somnia Online automatically assigns her character, Murmur, to the Enchanter class. Determined to overcome the unexpected setback, she assembles her guild, intent on the coveted number-one spot. Twelve keys stand between her and victory, but finding them is only part of the puzzle.&nbsp;</p> <p>Armed with telepathic abilities, Murmur rises to the challenge. However, old rivals have followed her to Somnia Online, desperate for revenge. Intricate quest lines become more dangerous as NPCs absorb powerful artifacts, and Murmur begins to wonder just what sort of AI controls the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Murmur questions her sanity as the real and virtual worlds mesh together. Everyone is keeping secrets from her, even the AI, and Murmur’s determined to uncover them.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>#2</b></p> <p>As Murmur reels in the wake of the secret her friends tried to keep, her grip on what is real and what is virtual begins to slip. What's more, she's no longer sure who she can trust.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stalked across the continent by a rogue with a vendetta, Murmur is forced to dig deep and develop her abilities before she finds a knife in her back.&nbsp;</p> <p>Suspicion surrounds the AIs as well. Their behaviors are too human, their reports too perfect. Shayla and Laria must uncover the truth before the system raises concerns and Murmur is lost forever.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>#3 </b></p> <p>Somnia is evolving, and Murmur is confronted with enemies both old and new. She must lead her guild, Fable, through a dungeon filled with riddles and puzzles to claim the first of 12 keys required to achieve victory. But things are not as they seem: Glitches abound, enemies rally against Fable, and unexpected threats move in the shadows.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the system becomes increasingly complex, Laria and Shayla battle through mismatched coding, and Storm Corp discovers they’ve left some anomalies in the game out of their reports. Anomalies like Wren. With the report deadline looming, and errors riddling the system, Laria’s house of cards is about to come crashing down.</p>";
