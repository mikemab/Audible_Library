window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the heartland of the west, earth magic is rising; in the blood of a boy descended from ancient kings, a sorcererâ€™s fire is igniting. As Graegor comes to know who he truly is and what destruction he can unleash, his self-control is tested by injustice, heresy, arrogance, love - and by the others like him. For he belongs to the next generation of power: nine new sorcerers, each possessing different strengths and shades of magic energy. With them come the prophecies and wars of their people, the fears and ambitions they keep secret, and the promise - or threat - of a new age...</p>";
