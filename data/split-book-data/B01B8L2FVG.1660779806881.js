window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Vaz</i> is the story of Vaz Gettnor, a socially impaired yet scientifically brilliant man. Despite his inability to relate to others, Lisanne married him in admiration of what she perceived as shy intelligence. However, she's been disappointed by the way he's settled for working as no more than a glorified lab tech with a low salary. </p> <p>Adding to their problems, Vaz and Lisanne have two teenagers who are typically surly and embarrassed by their parents, but whom they want to send to college - if only they can find the money. When Vaz is fired from his job as a researcher but then discovers a means to achieve cold fusion, a technology that could solve the energy crisis and their financial difficulties, virtually no one believes him, least of all his family. In fact the only people who do believe are the ones who are trying to steal the technology from him.... </p>";
