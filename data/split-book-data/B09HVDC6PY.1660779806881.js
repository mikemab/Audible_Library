window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The year is 1985: Nintendo has just hit the shelves, jean jackets are rad, MTV still plays music, and magic is very, very real.</p> <p>Jennifer Knight is fresh out of high school, still lives in her alcoholic mother’s house, has no car, and is so over everything, she’s taken to shoplifting simply for the fun of it. Of course, nicking what doesn’t belong to you is a whole lot easier when you possess a magic jewelry box with the power to make anything disappear.</p> <p>When a supernatural being with mysterious powers and suspect motives comes calling, however, it turns out Jen’s once dull, ordinary life is actually just window dressing - and that behind the curtain lies a whimsical world rife with wizards, wereskunks, and pot-smoking garden gnomes.</p> <p>In time and with the “aid” of her newfound acquaintance, Jen will find answers to questions she never thought to ask. Questions like “why can’t my mother talk about my father?” or “why is my rocker boyfriend never around when the full moon is out?” or “how suicidal do you have to be to rip off a wizard cabal on a dare?”<br> The answer? Very.</p> <p>But then you know what they say...ask not what magic can do for you, but what you can do for magic.</p>";
