The next, he was teleported across time and space onto the cold stone floor of an evil warlock.</p> <p>Locked in the warlock's tower through day and night, Ben may have to serve him for a while. He'll hate this, especially having to hunt those infernal demon rats when the warlock doesn't feed him well at all.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in a distant academy, a dragon is bored out of her mind. Unable to wear a saddle, no human dares mount her. Is there anyone in this land who can ride her into battle against the forces of the evil warlocks?

One, perhaps, who is currently sprinting right out of a warlock's front door....</p>";
