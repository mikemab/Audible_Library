Chakraborty continues the sweeping adventure begun in&nbsp;</b><b><i>The City of Brass </i></b><b>- \"the best adult fantasy I’ve read since&nbsp;</b><b><i>The Name of the Wind\"</i></b><b> (number-one&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;best-selling author Sabaa Tahir) - conjuring a world where djinn summon flames with the snap of a finger and waters run deep with old magic; where blood can be dangerous as any spell and a clever con artist from Cairo will alter the fate of a kingdom.</b></p> <p>Nahri’s life changed forever the moment she accidentally summoned Dara, a formidable, mysterious djinn, during one of her schemes. Whisked from her home in Cairo, she was thrust into the dazzling royal court of Daevabad - and quickly discovered she would need all her grifter instincts to survive there.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, with Daevabad entrenched in the dark aftermath of a devastating battle, Nahri must forge a new path for herself. But even as she embraces her heritage and the power it holds, she knows she’s been trapped in a gilded cage, watched by a king who rules from the throne that once belonged to her family - and one misstep will doom her tribe....</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ali has been exiled for daring to defy his father. Hunted by assassins, adrift on the unforgiving copper sands of his&nbsp;ancestral land, he is forced to rely on the frightening abilities the marid - the unpredictable water spirits - have gifted him. But in doing so, he threatens to unearth a terrible secret his family has long kept buried.</p> <p>As&nbsp;a new century approaches and the djinn gather within&nbsp;Daevabad's towering brass walls&nbsp;for celebrations, a threat brews unseen in the desolate North. It’s a force that would bring a storm of fire straight to the city’s&nbsp;gates...and&nbsp;one that seeks the aid of a warrior trapped between worlds, torn between a violent duty he can never escape and a peace he fears he will never deserve.</p>";
