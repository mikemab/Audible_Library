After an encounter with a mysterious, talking cat named Max, Pete and Zoey find themselves in a world named Round, a place that reminds them of an MMORPG - a massive multiplayer online role-playing game.</p> <p>The only way they can return home is if they save Round.... But before they can level up and become heroes, Pete and Zoey must learn to navigate tomato plant monsters, raccoon warlords, and countless display prompts. Those same display prompts tell Pete that his job is a pizzaman, but how can he be a pizzaman in a world where pizza doesn't exist?</p>";
