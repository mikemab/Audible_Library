window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rhapsody, n (1542). 1: a portion of an epic poem adapted for recitation. 2, archaic: a miscellaneous collection. 3 a (1): a highly emotional utterance (2): a highly emotional literary work (3): effusively rapturous or extravagant discourse b: rapture, ecstasy. 4: a musical composition of irregular form having an improvisatory character. </p><p>Elizabeth Haydon is a major new force in fantasy. Equipped with a quick wit, Haydon has a sharp ear for dialogue, panache with characters, and that essential ability to transport her readers into her own fantastical world--a world so real you can hear the sweet music of Rhapsody's aubade and smell the smoldering forges within the Cauldron. </p><p>Rhapsody is a woman, a singer of some talent who is swept up into events of world-shattering import. On the run from an old romantic interest who won't take no for an answer, Rhapsody literally bumps into a couple of shady characters: half breeds who come to her rescue in the nick of time. Only the rescue turns into an abduction, and Rhapsody soon finds herself dragged along on an epic voyage--one that spans centuries and ranges across a wonder-filled fantasy world. </p>";
