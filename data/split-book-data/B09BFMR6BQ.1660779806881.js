Her journey is interrupted when she decides to help a small village and learns that much of what she knows of the world may not be quite as it seems.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nathan Lowell blends Wiccan tradition and shamanistic lore into a fantasy quest for a new - if unlikely - heroine. She learns that the familiar sometimes hides the fantastic and that, even when you think you’ve made your decisions, life doesn’t always agree.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;Dan Sawyer, ArtisticWhispers Productions, Inc.</p>";
