window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This tale of healers with “talents” is the sixth in a series of stories featuring the psychically talented members of the Hyllis family. Hundreds of years after a plague induced apocalypse collapsed civilization back to iron and horsepower, the Hyllises have a genetic tendency to inherit “talents”. Eva Hyllis and her ancestors became healers because their talents let them feel inside their patients. This helps them diagnose the underlying causes of many illnesses. Eva’s children Tarc and Daussie have inherited telekinetic and teleportation talents. Their cousin Kazy’s a telepath. Telekinetic pressure can stop bleeding, teleportation can remove arterial plaques, and telepathy can provide anesthesia and correct psychopathy. In this audiobook, they set out on a treacherous journey to treat Eva’s sister who’s dying of cancer. And they keep finding more conditions that can be treated by their talents.</p>";
