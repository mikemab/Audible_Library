window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>To the Creshe Empire, I’m just a number.</p> <p>I’ve spent the past five years in isolation and under study. With my home razed by a Syldrari attack, my mind damaged, and nothing but white walls and a viewing window around me, I dedicated myself to two things: training my body, and reading any book they allowed me to have.</p> <p>The Empire wants me to serve, to use the inhuman power the Incident stirred within me. Technically, they asked, but it wasn’t much of a choice. It never is. Serve, or...I refused to be a mindless slave. My life was taken from me once. Never again.</p> <p>With the Empire moving forward with their xenophobic plans, they needed someone capable of killing Syldrari - and I was just that. A tool they could use, a tool they thought they could manipulate. Needing me was their first mistake. They gave me leverage; I named my terms.</p> <p>Now, after five years, my life can begin.</p> <p><i>Song of the Depths</i> is a slow-burn romantic science fantasy series with a constellation relationship dynamic and diverse cast.</p>";
