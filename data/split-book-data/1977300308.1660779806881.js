When an overburdened starship arrives, he becomes the link between the established colonists and the refugees from a ravaged Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Hella colony is barely self-sufficient. Can it stand the strain of a thousand new arrivals, bringing with them the same kinds of problems they thought they were fleeing?&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite the dangers to himself and his family, Kyle is in the middle of everything - in possession of the most dangerous secret of all. Will he be caught in a growing political conspiracy? Will his reawakened emotions overwhelm his rationality? Or will he be able to use his unique ability to prevent disaster?</p>";
