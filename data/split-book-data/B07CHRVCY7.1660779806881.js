window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Guy Fawkes' son must join his father's plot to kill the king if he's to survive the plague overtaking his body in this reimagined fantastical history of the Gunpowder Plot. Remember, remember the fifth of November.</p> <p>In 17th-century London, two forces rule the people: the color powers and the Stone Plague. Brown masks can manipulate wood. Black masks control the night. And red mask...well, red is the color of blood.</p> <p>Thomas Fawkes needs a gray mask so he can remove the stone that has invaded his body and will ultimately take his life. But when he fails his color test, his only hope is to track down his father, the infamous Guy Fawkes, and demand his color mask.</p> <p>But his father has other plans: to kill the king.</p> <p>Thomas must join forces with his father if he wants to save his own life. When his errands for the cause bring him time and again to Emma Areben, a former classmate, he is exposed to a whole new brand of magic.</p> <p>Emma doesn't control just one color - she controls them all.And she wants to show Thomas the full power of color magic, but it goes against everything his father is fighting for.</p> <p>If Thomas sides with his father, he could save his own life. But it would destroy Emma and her family. To save one, he must sacrifice the other.</p> <p>No matter Thomas' choice, one thing is clear: Once the decision is made and the color masks have been put on, there's no turning back.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>Fawkes</i></b><b>:</b></p> <p><b>\"An imaginative, colorful tale about choosing for yourself between what's right and what others insist is the truth.\" (Cynthia Hand, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>My Lady Jane</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"Hold on to your heart as this slow burning adventure quickly escalates into an explosion of magic, love, and the truth about loyalty.\" (Mary Weber, best-selling author of the Storm Siren Trilogy and </b><b><i>To Best the Boys</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"A magical retelling that will sweep you back in time - to a divided England where plagues can turn you to stone and magic has a voice.\" (Tosca Lee, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author)</b></p> <p><b>\"A must-read for all fantasy fans!\" (Lorie Langdon, author of </b><b><i>Olivia Twist</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"Brandes turns 17th-century London into a magical place.\" (Jill Williamson, author of </b><b><i>By Darkness Hid</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Captives</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
