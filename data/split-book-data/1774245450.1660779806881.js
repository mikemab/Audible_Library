She must master her powers or risk being destroyed by them. But as Void introduces her to levels and layers of magic she never even knew existed, she finds herself fighting desperately to keep up, to defeat challenge after challenge, to prove her worth to study under him, and to survive a training course that has killed lesser magicians.</p> <p>When Void sends her on a mysterious solo mission to a kingdom she's never visited, she finds herself facing a choice that could destroy her or unleash a nightmare that could destroy an entire kingdom.</p>";
