A budding serial killer in homeroom, a possible new romance, and high school algebra complicate his plans.</p> <p><i>The Redemption of Michael Hollister</i></p> <p>All Michael Hollister wanted was death. What he got was time travel.</p> <p>Convicted of murder and with nothing left to live for, Michael commits suicide in his jail cell in 1977, then opens his eyes in 1966, in his eight-year-old body, all memories of his previous life intact.
