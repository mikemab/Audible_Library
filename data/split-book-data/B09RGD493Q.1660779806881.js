window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Bioterror! </i></b><b>is the 14th book in a series of near-future sci-fi thrillers. Its heroine, Ell Donsaii, has a nerve mutation that makes her a genius and provides her with some astonishing athletic abilities. </b></p> <p>In <i>Bioterror!</i>, Ell’s son, Zage, a five-year-old prodigy, continues to follow his interests in biology and genetics, in keeping with his aim to eradicate what he perceives to be an obesity epidemic, partially driven by communicable viral diseases. His mother gets permission for him to skip ordinary primary and secondary schooling, and enrolls him in a university to study molecular genetics. He’ll be working in Dr. Reggie Barnes' research lab, where he hopes to learn how to take his ideas to the next level.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a talented virologist has joined a radical Islamic splinter group, promising to help them wipe nonbelievers from the face of the earth. He gets access to a forgotten smallpox culture and sets out to modify the already horrific disease into a more lethal version, one which won’t be prevented by standard vaccinations and is resistant to antiviral treatments.&nbsp;</p> <p>Zage has been working on a way to predict the proteins in viruses and recognize antigens in the viral shell that antibodies might be formed against. He’s hoping to immunize people against obesity viruses, but there’s no reason his new algorithm can’t also be used to stop the modified smallpox virus…if he can work with the CDC to make his vaccination available.</p>";
