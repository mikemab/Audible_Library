Looming Madness.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both Cal and Dale have become stronger, each in spite of the other.&nbsp;</p> <p>The dungeon - Cal - knows exactly how much their power has increased and is working daily to become exponentially more powerful. His schemes are becoming more complex and his dungeon - his body - more deadly.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dale works to subvert the plans of the dungeon, but his opponent is onto him.
