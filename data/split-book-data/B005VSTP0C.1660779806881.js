window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They are outcasts. Hal, Stig, and the others - they are the boys the others want no part of. Skandians, as any reader of <i>Ranger's Apprentice</i> could tell you, are known for their size and strength. Not these boys. Yet that doesn't mean they don't have skills. And courage - which they will need every ounce of to do battle at sea against the other bands, the Wolves and the Sharks, in the ultimate race. The icy waters make for a treacherous playing field - especially when not everyone thinks of it as playing. </p> <p>John Flanagan, author of the international phenomenon <i>Ranger's Apprentice</i>, creates a new cast of characters to populate his world of Skandians and Araluens, a world millions of young readers and listeners around the world have come to know and admire. Full of seafaring adventures and epic battles, Book 1 of The Brotherband Chronicles is sure to thrill fans of <i>Ranger's Apprentice</i> while enticing a whole new generation just now discovering the books.</p>";
