window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young man looking for death finds purpose in a world beyond our own in this sweeping fantasy from Greg Keyes (</b><b><i>The Briar King</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Newton’s Cannon</i></b><b>).</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Errol Greyson hadn’t intended to commit suicide. Or so he told himself. But waking up after his “cry for help” in the body of a wood-and-metal construct magically animated by Aster - the strange girl from school - was not a result he could have imagined.&nbsp;</p> <p>Aster’s wild explanations of a quest to find the water of health that would cure her father seemed as unreal as her description of Errol’s own half-dead existence, his consciousness stuck in an enchanted automaton while his real body was in a coma from which it might never wake. And of course, they would need to recruit a girl - a virgin, no less - who had been dead for thirty years, to lead them through something called the Pale, beyond which a bunch of magical kingdoms existed. Plus, the threat that Aster could turn him off like a light switch, sending him into a hellish oblivion, was a convincing incentive to cooperate.&nbsp;</p> <p>It all seemed quite mad: Either Aster was nuts, or Errol was hallucinating. But if it meant a new chance at life, he reckoned it was worth playing along.</p>";
