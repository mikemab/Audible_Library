But now, a friend needs help halfway across the galaxy - and with a military heritage coursing through her blood, it's time for Kris Longknife to be a hero. Kris boards the next ship to Turantic, the last place her friend was seen alive. But there's more to the rescue than meets the eye.<p> Turantic is not only the most twisted hellhole in the galaxy, but it's also under quarantine because of a deadly plague.

But she is willing to go even further - and deeper into Turantic's secrets - to survive.</p>";
