window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Q: How does a shanghaied computer geek conquer all the forces of darkness and win the love of the most beautiful witch in the world?</p> <p>A: By transforming himself from a demon programmer into a programmer of demons!</p> <p>It all began when the wizards of the White League were under attack by their opponents of the Black League and one of their most powerful members cast a spell to bring forth a mighty wizard to aid their cause. What the spell delivered was master hacker Walter \"Wiz\" Zumwalt. The wizard who cast the spell was dead and nobody - not the elves, not the dwarves, not even the dragons - could figure out what the shanghaied computer nerd was good for.</p> <p>But spells are a lot like computer programs, and, in spite of the Wiz's unprepossessing appearance, he was going to defeat the all-powerful Black League, win the love of a beautiful red-haired witch, and prove that when it comes to spells and sorcery, nobody but nobody can beat a Silicon Valley computer geek!</p>";
