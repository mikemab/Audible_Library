window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The aftermath of the virus left the world in shambles. Humanity was centuries from recovering. The devastation was caused not by pestilence and death as in past plagues, but by immortality, vitality, and infertility. The pandemic was so transformative that it became known as simply the Event.&nbsp;</p> <p>John Fitzpatrick, retired FBI agent, is consumed with exposing what, or who, is behind the Event. As John looks for answers, he must navigate a new world created by the Event, decades of world-wide depression and war, messianic cult leaders, and a meddlesome AI.&nbsp;</p> <p>Civilization survives the Event depression by uniting under one government. The Federation of Nations is led by a charismatic economist who restructures the world economy to focus on one goal: interstellar colonization. Centuries later, John’s obsession with the cause of the Event leads him to discover the forces behind the Event may threaten the launch of humanity’s first interstellar ship, <i>Atropos</i>, and plunge the world back into darkness.</p>";
