window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to New Londinium, a city that developed from an enclave of stragglers who survived the culminating blast of the last world war. From beneath the lee of a mountain formed as a result of the devastation, a colony gathered and grew. After several hundred years, this post-apocalyptic city is filled to bursting, and everyone - well, nearly everyone - is struggling for a place amidst the city’s Chosen, the elite ruling faction.&nbsp;</p> <p>Robert Mayhew, by all appearances, is a man destined to be numbered amongst these Chosen. But Mayhew is both more than and less than he appears. His unauthorized conception, and a hideous deformity that was the result of his failed termination, have left him with a bloodthirsty lust to exact vengeance on the system that conspired to kill him even before he’d drawn his first breath.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his position as chief curator of the Absinthe Moon - the city’s center of love and leisure - and supported by the Resistance, Mayhew is in just the right position to infiltrate the Icarus Project - the executive body of the city's shadow government - and bring the whole system toppling down. So long as no one gets in his way.&nbsp;</p> <p>Enter Emaline Newell. Utterly devoid of any evidence of the city’s taint, she is a valuable asset to the Absinthe Moon, and to Mayhew in his aims to achieve elite status. As his consort, she might give him just the advantage he needs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only Emaline has some ideas of her own, and perhaps a few things to teach him about love, loyalty, and the power he wishes to wield.</p>";
