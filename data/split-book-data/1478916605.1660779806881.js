But she still has all her ambitions, and no scruple will be permitted to stand in her way.</p> <p>For heroes like Leo dan Brock and Stour Nightfall, only happy with swords drawn, peace is an ordeal to end as soon as possible. But grievances must be nursed, power seized, and allies gathered first, while Rikke must master the power of the Long Eye...before it kills her.</p> <p>Unrest worms into every layer of society. The Breakers still lurk in the shadows, plotting to free the common man from his shackles, while noblemen bicker for their own advantage. Orso struggles to find a safe path through the maze of knives that is politics, only for his enemies, and his debts, to multiply.</p> <p>The old ways are swept aside, and the old leaders with them, but those who would seize the reins of power will find no alliance, no friendship, and no peace lasts forever.</p> <p>For more from Joe Abercrombie, check out:</p> <p><b>The Age of Madness</b><br> <i>A Little Hatred</i><br> <i>The Trouble With Peace</i></p> <p><b>The First Law Trilogy</b><br> <i>The Blade Itself</i><br> <i>Before They Are Hanged</i><br> <i>Last Argument of Kings</i><br> <i>Best Served Cold</i><br> <i>The Heroes</i><br> <i>Red Country</i></p> <p><b>The Shattered Sea Trilogy</b><br> <i>Half a King</i><br> <i>Half a World</i><br> <i>Half a War</i></p> <p><b>\"A master of his craft.\" (</b><b><i>Forbes</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"No one writes with the seismic scope or primal intensity of Joe Abercrombie.\" (Pierce Brown)</b></p>";
