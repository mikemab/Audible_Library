Occasionally, rumors arise: a king of the old blood has returned to claim his throne. These days, such claims are met with groans and eye-rolls. Pretenders abound . . . and are generally ignored.</p> <p>But scheming powers are plotting, machinations that have been in the works for years, and this time . . .</p> <p><b>Enter Merrik Niles. </b></p> <p>A thief hired by dangerous people to steal a map, he instead keeps it for himself, hoping to follow it to some mysterious prize.</p> <p>The treasure turns out to be an ancient artifact connected to Greymond's last king, and when Merrik touches it, he triggers long-dormant magic. Now, three ghosts have taken up permanent residence inside his mind: A cunning, smart-mouthed jester. A master swordsman. And a powerful wizard.</p> <p>At first, Merrik believes he's going mad, but at times, these troublesome ghosts lend him their powers . . . for good or for bad.</p> <p>Merrik is swept along in a scheme to put a fair-haired pretender on the throne of Greymond, making him the target of powerful enemies across the Scattered Kingdom who prefer the realm as it is.</p> <p>All the while, a new army rises across the mountains . . . and they're coming.</p> <p><b>Follow Merrik's exploits as a reluctant hero in the next epic fantasy series by Victor Gischler, the bestselling author of </b><b><i>Ink Mage</i></b><b>.
