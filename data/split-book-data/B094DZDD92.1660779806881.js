window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Twenty-four of the 23rd century’s best and brightest engineers and soldiers find themselves mysteriously transported to 1801 after their mining ship, <i>The Anaconda</i>, crosses a space-time warp in the Asteroid Belt. What will they do when they return to the New Earth - live in isolation on a Pacific Island, or put their God-like powers to work challenging Europe’s great empires on behalf of native peoples and slaves? Some believe history can be changed. Others think nudging civilization will only lead to disaster.</p>";
