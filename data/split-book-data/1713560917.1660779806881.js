window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For anyone who’s dreamed of immortality comes a twice-in-a-lifetime love story by Marc Levy, the phenomenal, internationally bestselling French author of </b><b><i>P.S. from Paris</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Last of the Stanfields</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>In Massachusetts, neuroscience students Luke, Josh, and Hope have formed an unbreakable and unconditional friendship. Bound by their wit, brilliance, and curiosity, they throw themselves heart and soul into their research and are on the verge of a revolution, pushing the limits of what’s possible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their new computer program can capture a person’s entire consciousness, memory, and personality - a digital map of the brain’s connections that promises to bridge the relationship between human and machine, between the past and the future. When Hope is diagnosed with a fatal and aggressive illness, their work takes on a new significance and urgency. Everything that defines who Hope is, and everything Luke and Josh love about her, will not be lost. Memory by memory, they’re going to make sure of it. <i>Hope</i> is a heartwarming story about the boundaries of love, life, and death - and what will endure with us forever.</p>";
