window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Taut and elegant, carefully introspected and thoughtfully explored.\" (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>From Hugo award-winning author Sarah Pinsker comes a novel about one family and the technology that divides them.</b></p> <p><b><i>Everybody's getting one.</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Val and Julie just want whatâ€™s best for their kids, David and Sophie. So when teenage son David comes home one day asking for a Pilot, a new brain implant to help with school, they reluctantly agree. This is the future, after all.&nbsp;</p> <p>Soon, Julie feels mounting pressure at work to get a Pilot to keep pace with her colleagues, leaving Val and Sophie part of the shrinking minority of people&nbsp;without the device.&nbsp;</p> <p>Before long, the implications are clear for the family and society: Get a Pilot or get left behind. With government subsidies and no downside, why would anyone refuse? And how do you stop a technology once it's everywhere? Those are the questions Sophie and her anti-Pilot movement rise up to answer,&nbsp;even if it puts them up against the Pilot's powerful manufacturer and pits Sophie against the people she loves most.</p>";
