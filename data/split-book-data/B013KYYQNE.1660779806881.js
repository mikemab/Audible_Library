When you fight magic with magic, nothing is certain.\" </p> <p>Balfruss is a battlemage, one of a vanishing breed, sworn to fight and die for a country that fears and despises him. </p> <p>Vargus is a soldier, and while mages shoot lightning from the walls of his city, he's down in the frontlines getting blood on his blade. </p> <p>Talandra is a princess and her father's spymaster, but the war may force her to take up a greater responsibility and make the greatest sacrifice of all. </p> <p>Known for their unpredictable, dangerous power, society has left battlemages untrained and shunned. But when a force unlike anything ever imagined attacks their home, the few remaining magic users must go to war - to save those who fear them most and herald in a new age of peace, built upon the corpses of their enemies.</p>";
