He can't even use the cutting-edge hardware that would allow him to play in the full-immersion-games that have become so popular. This all changes when he hears from New Universal Frontiers, the company with the best game out there: World of Magic.</p> <p>They offer him the ability to use their hardware despite his injuries, but at a cost...he can never leave the game.</p> <p>Once in the game world, Lox quickly realizes that there is a lot more to this new realm than just a game.
