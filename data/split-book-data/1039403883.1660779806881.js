window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The company that Arya Vaii and Gunnar Schmidt founded to commercially develop Arya's time-stopping discovery is making money hand over fist. </b></p> <p>Currently, their profits come from their use of the phenomenal physical properties of a time-stopped segment of space-time to build rockets. But now, they’re building their space tower. Taking off at a 30-degree angle from Eastern Virginia, it’s 200 kilometers long and 100 kilometers high. By placing the interior of their spacecraft - and its passengers - in stasis, they can accelerate launches at 15 gravities, reaching orbital speeds before the craft leaves the rail. This lets them put payloads in orbit for a thousand times lower cost than a rocket.</p> <p>The world, and some unscrupulous people, are turning to Kaem and his company to further our exploitation of orbital space.</p>";
