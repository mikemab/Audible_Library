window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Samantha Allen, award-winning journalist and author of <i>Real Queer America</i>, delivers an intimate look at the unexpectedly hilarious moments of her gender transition.</p> <p>In this poignant audio piece, Samantha Allen takes listeners along for the wild ride of her own transition: The good, the bad, but mostly, the funny. Because once she began this life-changing journey in earnest, Samantha realized that while the emotional trials of gender dysphoria and self-discovery could be harrowing, there were so many laugh-out-loud moments along this winding road.</p> <p>Think about it: While her 20- and 30-something peers were settling into the people they were going to be for the rest of their lives, Samantha was going through puberty all over again, taking the whole womanhood thing step by glamorous step - from learning the differences between men’s and women’s public restrooms to figuring out how to take off a bra without taking her shirt off first. Recognizing these moments of humor brought her joy in times she needed it most - and sharing them, she learned, could be revelatory.&nbsp;</p> <p>Part deeply personal memoir, part comedic adventure, and part insightful exploration of how gender informs the ways we see the world, <i>M to (WT)F</i> is a delightful listen that proves how powerful it can be to find humor in hardship.</p> <p><b>If you are interested in learning more about transgender and non-binary advocacy, we encourage you to visit the official websites of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund (tldef.org) and Mermaids (mermaidsuk.org.uk).</b></p>";
