In these ancient days, Elminster is but a shepherd boy, dreaming of adventure and heroics. When a dragon-riding magelord sweeps down upon him, though, the boy is thrust into a world of harsh realities, corrupt rulers, and evil sorcerers. </p> <p>With patience and grit, Elminster sets about to change all that. The result of his labors is a world reborn and a mage made.</p>";
