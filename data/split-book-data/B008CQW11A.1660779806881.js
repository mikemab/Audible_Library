window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Strikingly original in its conception, ambitious in scope, with characters engrossingly and vividly drawn, the first book in R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing series creates a remarkable world from whole cloth - its language and classes of people, its cities, religions, mysteries, taboos, and rituals - the kind of all-embracing universe Tolkien and Herbert created unforgettably in the epic fantasies <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Dune.</i> </p> <p>It's a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both 2,000 years past and 2,000 years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveler, Anas√ªrimbor Kellhus - part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence - from lands long thought dead. <i>The Darkness That Comes Before</i> is a history of this great holy war, and like all histories, the survivors write its conclusion.</p>";
