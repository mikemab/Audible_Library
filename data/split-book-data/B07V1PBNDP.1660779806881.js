Brain cancer was turning into a real drag....</p> <p>The government owns the list though, and they’ve wasted no time snapping him up. According to them, he has 13 days in an alien realm to learn as much as he can before the inevitable, at which point his memories, skill progressions, and weapon proficiencies will endure despite his body resetting.</p> <p>Then it’s rinse and repeat.</p> <p>But there are unwritten rules to the game he’s about to play, and unseen forces acting in judgment.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Adam will have to learn the hard way that dying is the easiest thing he’s going to do today.</b></p>";
