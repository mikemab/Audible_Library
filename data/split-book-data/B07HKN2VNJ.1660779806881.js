window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>An Ember in the Ashes</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>Three Dark Crowns</i></b><b> in this lush debut fantasy novel about a girl who disguises herself as a boy to join a secret group of warriors who ride phoenixes into battle.</b></p> <p><b><i>I had a sister once....</i></b></p> <p>In a world ruled by fierce warrior queens, a grand empire was built upon the backs of Phoenix Riders - legendary heroes who soared through the sky on wings of fire - until a war between two sisters ripped it all apart.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>I promised her the throne would not come between us. </i></b></p> <p>Sixteen years later, Veronyka is a war orphan who dreams of becoming a Phoenix Rider from the stories of old. After a shocking betrayal from her controlling sister, Veronyka strikes out alone to find the Riders - even if that means disguising herself as a boy to join their ranks.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>But it is a fact of life that one must kill or be killed. Rule or be ruled. </i></b></p> <p>Just as Veronyka finally feels like she belongs, her sister turns up and reveals a tangled web of lies between them that will change everything. And meanwhile, the new empire has learned of the Riders’ return and intends to destroy them once and for all.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Sometimes the title of queen is given. Sometimes it must be taken. </i></b></p> <p><i>Crown of Feathers </i>is an epic fantasy about love’s incredible power to save - or to destroy. Interspersed throughout is the story of Avalkyra Ashfire, the last Rider queen, who would rather see her empire burn than fall into her sister’s hands.</p>";
