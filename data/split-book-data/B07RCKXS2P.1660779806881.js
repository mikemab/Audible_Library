Now he’s fighting for his life. <br> &nbsp;</p> <p>When a mysterious hacker takes control of Hundred Kingdoms, Jack is trapped inside the fantasy VR world along with millions of other players. But Jack is in a worse predicament. He’s cornered in the very tower the terrorists have taken as their base; the only free player left within its walls. Even worse, in the real world, his body lies in a sweltering room with no hope of relief. <br> &nbsp;</p> <p>Playing the profession-based Scavenger class, and at a low level, Jack’s prospects of fighting his way out are next to impossible. Crafting gear, traps, and weapons, allying with a deadly dungeon master and an AI he can’t fully trust, Jack is in a race against time to save not just himself but the millions of players held hostage.<br> &nbsp;</p> <p><i>Battle Spire</i> is a meeting of <i>World of Warcraft</i> and <i>Die Hard</i>, using crunchy LitRPG mechanics with a heavy focus on crafting.
