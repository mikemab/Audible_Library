window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Stormy Morgan left her hometown of Shadow Hills, Michigan, with one goal: To write the great American novel and strike it rich. She sold her novel not long after college, did relatively well, and then fell off a cliff into obscurity. Now, without a book contract, she’s back at her family restaurant in a one-stoplight town...and she’s convinced things couldn’t possibly get worse.</p> <p>That feeling only lasts until her first shift, when on a trip to the storage building behind the restaurant, she literally trips over a body.</p> <p>Roy Axe, Shadow Hills most hated “Axehole”, died a hard death only feet from the restaurant (and the second-floor apartment Stormy currently resides in). The detective on the case is none other than Hunter Ryan, Stormy’s high school boyfriend, and the man who occasionally still calls to her in dreams. Hunter only cares about solving a mystery - nothing else - so their reunion is tense.</p> <p>In an attempt to distract herself from what’s happening, Stormy and her cousin Alice get drunk one night and pull out their great-grandmother’s old Ouija board, and it sets off a strange string of events, most of which seem magical...if you believe in that sort of thing, and Stormy isn’t sure she does.</p> <p>Stormy has trouble deciding which problem to focus on, so she avoids them all until things start blowing up in her face.</p> <p>Shadow Hills is a small town but the secrets that plague it run deep. Stormy is a woman - or maybe a witch - lost in a sea of magic and despair...but murder might just lead her out of it. That is if she can survive to solve the case, that is.</p>";
