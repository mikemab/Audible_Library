window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The instant </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller</b></p> <p><b>The alternate-history first-contact adventure </b><b><i>Axiom's End</i></b><b> is an extraordinary debut from Hugo finalist and video essayist Lindsay Ellis. Truth is a human right.</b></p> <p>It's fall 2007. A well-timed leak has revealed that the US government might have engaged in first contact. Cora Sabino is doing everything she can to avoid the whole mess, since the force driving the controversy is her whistleblower father. Even though Cora hasn't spoken to him in years, his celebrity has caught the attention of the press, the internet, the paparazzi, and the government - and with him in hiding, that attention is on her. She neither knows nor cares whether her father's leaks are a hoax and wants nothing to do with him - until she learns just how deeply entrenched her family is in the cover-up and that an extraterrestrial presence has been on Earth for decades.</p> <p>Realizing the extent to which both she and the public have been lied to, she sets out to gather as much information as she can and finds that the best way for her to uncover the truth is not as a whistleblower, but as an intermediary. The alien presence has been completely uncommunicative until she convinces one of them that she can act as their interpreter, becoming the first and only human vessel of communication. Their otherworldly connection will change everything she thought she knew about being human - and could unleash a force more sinister than she ever imagined.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press&nbsp;</b></p> <p>\"<i>Axiom’s End</i> is one of the most unique science fiction novels in years. It’s a heartfelt story of alien first contact, but, luckily, unlike so many 'big idea' sci-fi books, it’s utterly unpretentious.\" (SYFY.com)</p>";
