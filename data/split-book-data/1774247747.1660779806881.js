window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Captain Galvin Quintos had returned home to Earth soon after liberating Ironhold Station from a ruthless band of Pylorian pirates. But the Grish had been waiting for his transport ship - an attack he barely survived. Now, three months later, he’s still recuperating within the walls of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just today, Quintos has learned of a new intergalactic adversary - a highly advanced alien force, the Varapin - who are currently en route from the Andromeda Galaxy. Intel has it, these ghoulish-looking aliens are now aligned with the Grish, and together, they’re hell-bent on annihilating all humanity. Quintos, certain his crew has already moved on to other posts and his ship, the <i>USS Hamilton</i>, surely still in space dock with battle damage, must figure out how to get back into the fight, and do so fast.</p>";
