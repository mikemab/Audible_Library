As he adjusts to his new circumstances, he’s briefed on his first mission: To liberate the city of Mahns-a-Lore. In order to be successful, he is given a Mech Core and acquires the Cymech class.</p> <p>There's just one problem: He's got no resources, apart from a mangy kid. At least the kid is a savvy engineer. With mere pieces of a mech build, Gnath is supposed to level up and take on dangerous enemies. Oh yea — he's also got to watch his stabilization. If he doesn't, he risks dying to the Cyborg effect.</p>";
