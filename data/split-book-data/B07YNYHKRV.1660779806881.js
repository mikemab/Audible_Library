Any family created without a government permit is declared illegal and is mercilessly hunted, arrested, and often, killed. Their illegal children are sent to reeducation centers where department-approved classes can ensure their distorted views are not passed on.</p> <p>For 16-year-old Maggie Ward, growing up in one of these centers is all she’s ever known. But after learning her brother is secretly being trained as a Remo - government agent that violently breaks up illegal families - she concocts a plan to escape.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of a tech-savvy illegal, they locate the Resistance and finally learn their parents’ identities.
