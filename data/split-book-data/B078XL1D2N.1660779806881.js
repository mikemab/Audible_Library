window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wizard scouts, once the greatest fighting force the galaxy has ever known, face extinction as the Intergalactic Empire's war of attrition with the bat-like Crosioians takes its toll. In a desperate all-or-nothing attempt to snatch victory from defeat, the Empire calls on Wizard Scout Richard Shepard, the last of the legendary wizard scouts, to pave the way for the largest invasion force the Empire has ever assembled. Caught in political crosscurrents that could change the Empire forever, Richard's only allies are his battle computer and the elf high priestess, Jeena.</p> <p>As fleets of starships battle it out, human and elf are forced to find a way to overcome their prejudices long enough to fight their common enemy. Thrust from one frightening nightmare to another, the two discover an intergalactic war may be the least of their worries, as demonic forces assemble to overwhelm three galaxies. Richard and Jeena soon discover their only path to victory may well require sacrifices beyond anything they have ever imagined.</p> <p>Are Richard and Jeena the star-crossed lovers foretold in prophecy? Can two such disparate races work together to avert the pending crisis, or are they destined for slaughter along with every other living being? In a backdrop of intergalactic warfare the likes of which the galaxy has never seen, a lone wizard scout and an elf high priestess try to hold back the forces of darkness long enough to make a difference. It may well be too much to ask, even for a wizard scout.</p>";
