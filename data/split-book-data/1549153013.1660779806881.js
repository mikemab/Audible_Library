window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Legacy of Ash </i></b><b>is an unmissable fantasy debut - an epic tale of intrigue and revolution, soldiers and assassins, ancient magic and the eternal clash of empires. </b></p> <p><i>A shadow has fallen over the Tressian Republic. </i></p> <p>Ruling families - once protectors of justice and democracy - now plot against one another with sharp words and sharper knives. Blinded by ambition, they remain heedless of the threat posed by the invading armies of the Hadari Empire.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Yet as Tressia falls, heroes rise. </i></p> <p>Viktor Akadra is the Republic's champion. A warrior without equal, he hides a secret that would see him burned as a heretic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Josiri Trelan is Viktor's sworn enemy. A political prisoner, he dreams of reigniting his mother's failed rebellion.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet Calenne Trelan, Josiri's sister, seeks only to break free of their tarnished legacy; to escape the expectation and prejudice that haunts the family name.&nbsp;</p> <p>As war spreads across the Republic, these three must set aside their differences in order to save their home. Yet decades of bad blood are not easily set aside. And victory - if it comes at all - will demand a darker price than any of them could have imagined.</p>";
