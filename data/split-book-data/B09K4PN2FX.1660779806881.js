window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first publication of a lost fantasy novel. <i>Aspects</i> has sorcery and politics and romance in an alternate 18th century setting. At last, the final work of one of the greatest SF and fantasy authors of his time.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"How had a writer this good fallen into this level of obscurity?\" (<i>Slate</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>John M. Ford was the kind of writer that made audiences’ eyes light up and made other writers want to either worship him or assassinate him. He was a brilliant stylist and clever storyteller. He wrote everything. Short stories (award winners), novels (award winners), plays, poetry (award-winning), sketches, comedy monologs, games, Star Trek™ tie-ins, puzzles and parodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In the years before his unexpected death, he was working on a novel—a long fantasy of magic, railroads, politics and abdicated kings, swords and sorcerous machine guns, divination and ancient empires.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Now <i>Aspects</i> is in your hands. Come enter the halls of Parliament with Varic, Coron of the Corvaric Coast. Come to visit Strange House with the Archmage Birch. Explore the mountains of Lady Longlight’s Coronage of the Great Rogue Hills, alongside the Palion Silvern, Armiger/Sorcerer. Explore Lystourel, capital city of the Republic of Lescoray and the world so complexly created in the chapters of this novel.</p>";
