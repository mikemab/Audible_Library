window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For months, the Tail of Nine Stars systems had been preparing a mission to the Xegachtznel Galaxy to stop the alien Vachisy Empire in its prodigious expansion, enslaving planetary populations of its own race while committing genocide on white and yellow sun human inhabited planets. The advanced race of post-humaniod Amonrahonians, who had given Om its current galaxy maps and emanation model of the universe, had warned that the Vachisy Empire would discover the Tail of Nine Starsâ€™ solarium deposits and attempt to exterminate the biospheres of its three inhabited star systems. Now a new problem had just arisen with the far lower-tech Kundabuffer Empire in their own galaxy of Hub about to attack and enslave the Ganahar system of the Raster Republic. A person vital to the Xegachtznel mission was living on Ganahar. This person and a warrior monk of the Clear Light Order on Om were crucial to finding a way to stop the Vachisy Empire, of more than 1,100 enslaved inhabited planets.</p>";
