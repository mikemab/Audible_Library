window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It’s been six months since I died on Earth and was brought to the kingdom of Craesti. In that time, I’ve made friends, gained a family, and begun learning how to gather and channel Aether, aka magic. I started attending Azyl Academy, the premier magic school of the city, after it was discovered that my talent was exceptionally high. I am learning alchemy, inscription, and how to fight, all with the goal of expanding the kingdom and keeping the populace safe.&nbsp;</p> <p>It hasn’t all been smooth sailing, though. I made an enemy of one of the local noble clans, and just survived an assassination attempt thanks to one of the guardian beasts of the academy I have a budding friendship with. Now I have to recover from my injuries and continue to advance. Coming soon will be our ranking tournament, where we will compete within our tiers to see who is the strongest.&nbsp;</p> <p>After the tournament, we will be divided into teams and go on an expedition into the Great Western Forest to cull beasts and harvest rare plants. Throughout all of this, though, my focus is on getting stronger; to be ready for the calamity I was warned about by Darkness, the deity that brought me here. I just hope I have enough time.</p>";
