window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this spirited sequel to the acclaimed <i>The Rook</i>, Myfanwy Thomas returns to clinch an alliance between deadly rivals and avert epic - and slimy - supernatural war.</b> </p> <p>When secret organizations are forced to merge after years of enmity and bloodshed, only one person has the fearsome powers - and the bureaucratic finesse - to get the job done. Facing her greatest challenge yet, Rook Myfanwy Thomas must broker a deal between two bitter adversaries: </p> <p>The Checquy - the centuries-old covert British organization that protects society from supernatural threats, and... </p> <p>The Grafters - a centuries-old supernatural threat. </p> <p>But as bizarre attacks sweep London, threatening to sabotage negotiations, old hatreds flare. Surrounded by spies, only the Rook and two women who absolutely hate each other can seek out the culprits before they trigger a devastating otherworldly war. </p> <p><i>Stiletto</i> is a novel of preternatural diplomacy, paranoia, and snide remarks from an author who \"adroitly straddles the thin line between fantasy, thriller, and spoof\" (<i>Booklist</i>). </p>";
