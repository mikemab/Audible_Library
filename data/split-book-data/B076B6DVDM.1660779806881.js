window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Starship engineer Anailu Xindar dreamed of owning her own ship, but she didn't find the courage to actually go for it until she was forced out of her safe, comfortable job. She goes shopping for a cheap, practical freighter, but she ends up buying a rare, beautiful, but crippled luxury ship. Getting it into space will take more than her technical skills. She'll have to go way outside her comfort zone to brave the dangers of safaris, formal dinners, a rude professor, and, worst of all, a fashion designer. She may even have to make some friends...and enemies. </p> <p><i>The Sculpted Ship</i> is set on the outskirts of an interstellar empire where FTL travel is commonplace but intelligent robots are rare and expensive. Though the Iris Empire has stood for 1,000 years, a talented individual can find plenty of opportunity. But the nobility of this empire guards its privileges jealously. </p>";
