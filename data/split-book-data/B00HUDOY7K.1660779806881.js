window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Terran Union is engaged in a vast interstellar war against the Krag Ruthless aliens intent on exterminating humankind. In 2315, the wily Max Robichaux is given command of the USS <i>Cumberland,</i> a destroyer with state-of-the-art capabilities but a combat record so bad, she’s known as the “<i>Cumberland</i> Gap.” Capt. Robichaux’s first mission: to take his warship to the Free Corridor, where the Krag have secretly been buying strategic materials, and to seize or destroy any ships carrying enemy cargo. Far from the fleet and under enforced radio silence, Max relies only on his determination and guile…and the support and friendship of his chief medical officer, the brilliant Dr. Sahin. Because even as he deals with the ship’s onboard problems and the stress of carrying out her risky assignment, Max and the doctor discover that the <i>Cumberland</i> and her misfit crew are all that stands in the way of a deadly Krag attack that threatens to end the war - and humanity - once and for all. A far-future story in the tradition of “ships of wood, men of iron” novels, <i>To Honor You Call Us</i> and the <i>Man of War</i> series combine the adventure of exploration, the excitement of war, and the dangers of the unknown through the eyes of a ship and her crew. </p>";
