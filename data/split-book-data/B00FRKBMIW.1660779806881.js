window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Smith and Trowbridge describe the flavor of their five-book space opera Exordium as a cross between <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Dangerous Liaisons</i> with a touch of the <i>Three Stooges</i>. With its fast-moving blend of humor and horror, of high-tech skiffy and the deep places of the human heart, <i>The Phoenix in Flight</i> launches the reader into a complex, multi-layered universe as Brandon nyr-Arkad, dissolute youngest son of the ruler of the Thousand Suns, abandons the life of service planned for him and flees into the lawless Rift. </p><p>Only slowly does he discover that the world he rejected now lies in smoking ruins as the ritual vengeance of Jerrode Eusabian against Brandonâ€™s father, twenty years in preparation, culminates in an explosion of interstellar violence. With both his brothers dead and his father the Panarch imprisoned, Brandon becomes the Panarchy's last hope. </p>";
