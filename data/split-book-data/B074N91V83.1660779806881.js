window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>12-year-old Aidan Errolson, comes from a long line of adventurers. His grandparents were among the first settlers of Corenwald's Eastern Frontier. His father had been one of the kingdom's greatest warriors. Aidan, on the other hand, lives the quiet, comfortable life, of a nobleman's son. He never has any real adventures, and that, he believes, is the one great injustice of his otherwise happy life. </p> <p>All that will change the day he first hears the bark of the bog owl, and meets Dobro Turtlebane. Dobro is one of the feechiefolk, a tribe of half-civilized swamp dwellers who fight too much, laugh too loud, cry too easily, and smell just terrible. But another meeting on that remarkable day may change Aidan's life even more profoundly. Bayard the Truthspeaker arrives with a startling pronouncement: Aidan Errolson will grow to be the Wilderking, the long-prophesied wild man, who will come out of Corenwald's forests and swamps to lead the kingdom back to its former glory. There's just one question: Is Bayard the Truthspeaker a prophet or a madman? This initial installment in <i>The Wilderking Trilogy</i> is sure to capture the hearts of young and old, boys and girls alike. </p>";
