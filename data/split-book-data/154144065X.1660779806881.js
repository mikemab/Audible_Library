But a freak storm over the Atlantic propels the airliner unexplainably back in time to the early 18th century. They find themselves on the sparsely populated coast of the Carolina Colony. Charles Town is the only English settlement of any size in the area. It's an inhospitable place of vast plantations, slavery, hostile natives, tall ships, and marauding pirates.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finding a way back, if that's even feasible, is the least of their worries. These unintended time travelers quickly find themselves ill-equipped for hardships and dangers not faced for centuries. Perils loom at every turn in this world of loss, anguish, filth, and sweat.&nbsp;</p> <p>Foreigners in their own land, can they survive and adapt? Is it even possible for these modern transplants to carve an existence from this foul and odorous place in time?&nbsp;</p> <p>Stephen Mason will find a way or die trying.</p>";
