window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Devon Walker has one chance to turn her life around. A half-wit ogre, a legion of overgrown jungle beasts, and a power-tripping AI are trying to stop her.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Relic Online</i> is the hottest new game out there, and it's Devon Walker's best hope for escaping her hard-knock life. Thanks to her rocking achievements in other games, she's been hired as a salaried player. Even better, her new position comes with cutting-edge implants that turn RO's virtual reality into a full-sensory explosion. Her only task? Drive the game's creator AI to the outermost limits of its creativity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sounds easy, right?&nbsp;</p> <p>But when Devon logs in, her expectations shatter like an ice golem hit with a sonic blast. Wearing nothing but a cloth tunic and ragged pants, she spawns inside a ruined city overgrown by steamy jungle. With zero skills and nothing in her inventory but pocket lint, she immediately runs afoul of the city's guardian, a stone golem the size of an apartment building. The encounter does not go well.&nbsp;</p> <p>And <i>Relic Online</i> is just getting started with her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Soundbooth Theater brings you another instant GameLit classic, narrated by Annie Ellicott. Paired with our troupe's vocal chameleon, Annie delivers yet another wonderful performance that brings Carrie Summers's world of <i>Relic Online</i> to life and will keep you hooked into this story filled with fast-paced action and methodically crunchy crafting and town building.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production:&nbsp;</p> <p>Annie Ellicott - Narration and female characters&nbsp;</p> <p>Jeff Hays - Male characters&nbsp;</p> <p>Ivy Sherrard - Proofing, editing&nbsp;</p> <p>Griffin Malnar - Production, editing, mastering</p>";
