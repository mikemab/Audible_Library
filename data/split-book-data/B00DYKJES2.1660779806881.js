window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>If a machine could predict how you would die, would you want to know? This is the tantalizing premise of </b><b><i>This Is How You Die</i></b><b>, the brilliant follow-up anthology to the self-published best seller, </b><b><i>Machine of Death</i></b><b>.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>The machines started popping up around the world. The offer was tempting: with a simple blood test, anyone could know how they would die. But the machines didn't give dates or specific circumstances - just a single word or phrase. Drowned, cancer, old age, choked on a handful of popcorn. And though the predictions were always accurate, they were also often frustratingly vague.&nbsp;</p> <p>Old age, it turned out, could mean either dying of natural causes, or being shot by an elderly, bedridden man in a botched home invasion. The machines held onto that old-world sense of irony in death: you can know how it's going to happen, but you'll still be surprised when it does. This addictive anthology - sinister, witty, existential, and fascinating - collects the best of the thousands of story submissions the editors received in the wake of the success of the first volume, and exceeds the first in every way.&nbsp;</p>";
