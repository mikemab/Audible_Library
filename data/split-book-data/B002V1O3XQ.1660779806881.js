Now, the U.S. military has been ordered to wrest control of Earth's satellite from their rivals. Sergeant Ethan Stark must train his squadron to fight in an airless atmosphere at one-sixth normal gravity against a desperate enemy. Ensuring his team's survival means choosing between which orders to obey - and which to ignore. <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: Includes an exclusive introduction written and read by author Jack Campbell.</b></p> <p><i>Stark's War</i> was originally published as \"by John G.
