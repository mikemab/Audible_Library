window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Evan never thought he was going to be special. As the adopted son of a tailor, he had always expected to manage the shop after his father passed. But when his Aura awakens, he finds himself entering Yesgol Academy of Magic, a place filled with the children of elite mages and nobles, all of whom have had magical education from the time they could walk. Among such prestigious company, Evan will have to learn fast or be left in the dust and in debt.</p> <p>At Yesgol, he studies the arts of enchanting and divination, but all is not as it seems. As Evan pushes forward his skills as a mage to catch up with his peers, he finds himself entangled with a secret society for the reformation of magic, deals with the occasional extraplanar horror appearing in the shadows of the school, and catches the eye of a charming young noble who's been excommunicated from his family.</p>";
