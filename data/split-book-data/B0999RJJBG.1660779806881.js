window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Travel from a Land of Skies isolated in space to civilisations flourishing underground, from a chaos curtain to sacred sites and more, in this epic fantasy/sci-fi omnibus. <i>Lore of Arcana Omnibus</i> includes <i>The Infinity Mantle</i>, <i>The Kinfire Tree</i>, <i>The Drowned Throne</i>, and <i>The Dragon Circle </i>and delves from the deep and forgotten past into a speculative future, knowing time cannot be truly measured. Time moves between realms and reality in a fashion contradictory to our present, and exposes creatures of myth and legend and fabled figures thought lost to antiquity. Lore of Arcana uncovers profound secrets and mysteries, but the true connection that serves to bind is the great Maghdim Medaillon, the ‘Secret Wisdom’ able to breach realms and time. One man strides through all, Maghdim Medaillon in one hand, sword in the other. He is the Pathfinder, Keeper of the Dragon, the ultimate architect and elixir of life. He is the secret, the kingdom, and the sacred space. He is Lifegiver and Destroyer. This is Rayne’s journey, he who is also Torrullin, descendant of a mighty bloodline, and this is a mighty tale.</p>";
