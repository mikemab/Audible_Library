window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author of <i>Dark Space</i>. A mission to another world could be our only hope.... </b></p><p><b>The year is AD 2790. With space elevators and giant orbital fleets hovering over Earth, open war looks inevitable, and people are anxious to get away. The lines are drawn, with the Confederacy in the East and the First World Alliance in the West. In hopes of finding a refuge from the looming war, the Alliance is sending Captain Alexander de Leon to explore an Earth-type planet, code-named Wonderland, but at the last minute before launch, a Confederate fleet leaves orbit on a trajectory that threatens both the mission and Alliance sovereignty. The resulting power struggle will determine not only the fate of Alexander's mission but the fate of the entire human race. </b></p>";
