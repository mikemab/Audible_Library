And with talent scouts in the audience wowed by his latest performance, he knows he’s about to make the big-time.</p> <p>What he doesn’t expect is an offer to go on a quest to a place where magic is all too real.</p> <p>That’s how he finds himself in Alissia, a world connected to ours by a secret portal owned by a powerful corporation. He’s after an employee who has gone rogue, and that’s the least of his problems. Alissia has true magicians...and the penalty for impersonating one is death. In a world where even a 12-year-old could beat Quinn in a sword fight, it’s only a matter of time until the tricks up his sleeves run out.</p>";
