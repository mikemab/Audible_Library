window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Pursuit of the Pankera</i>&nbsp;is one of the most audacious experiments ever done in science fiction by the legendary author of the classic best seller&nbsp;<i>Starship Troopers.</i></p> <p>Robert A. Heinlein wrote&nbsp;<i>The Number of the Beast</i>, which was published in 1980. In the book Zeb, Deety, Hilda, and Jake are ambushed by the alien \"Black Hats\" and barely escape with their lives on a specially configured vehicle (the&nbsp;<i>Gay Deceiver</i>) which can travel along various planes of existence, allowing them to visit parallel universes.</p> <p>However, unknown to most fans, Heinlein had already written a \"parallel\" novel about the four characters and parallel universes in 1977. He effectively wrote two parallel novels about parallel universes. The novels share the same start, but as soon as the&nbsp;<i>Gay Deceiver</i>&nbsp;is used to transport them to a parallel universe, each book transports them to a totally different parallel world.</p> <p>From that point on the plot lines diverge completely. While&nbsp;<i>The Number of the Beast</i>&nbsp;morphs into something very different, more representative of later Heinlein works,&nbsp;<i>The Pursuit of the Pankera</i>&nbsp;remains on target with a much more traditional Heinleinesque storyline and ending, reminiscent of his earlier works.</p> <p><i>The Pursuit of the Pankera</i>&nbsp;was never published, and there have been many competing theories as to why (including significant copyright issues in 1977). Over time the manuscript was largely forgotten but survived in fragments. A recent re-examination of these fragments, however, made it clear that they constitute the complete novel.</p> <p>And here it finally is: Robert A. Heinlein's audacious experiment. A fitting farewell from one of the most inventive science fiction writers to have ever lived: a parallel novel about parallel universes, as well as a great adventure pitting the forces of good versus evil only the way Heinlein could do.</p>";
