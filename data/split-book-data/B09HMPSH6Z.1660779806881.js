window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The followup to <i>Bonesetter</i>, a pre historical account of a boy in a primitive society who learns to \"set bones\". In this second story he’s become a young man, and the tale follows his development as a brilliant inventor of ancient technologies. New tools that markedly improve the lives of his fellow humans. He gathers others to his new tribe, gains his adult physical coordination and finishes rescuing his old tribe from starvation. Despite the awe his ideas engender in those around him, he remains humble and commits himself to helping those in need - even those he doesn’t like.</p>";
