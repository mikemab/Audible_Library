Anderson triumphantly returns to epic fantasy with the Wake the Dragon series. </b><b><i>Spine of the Dragon</i></b><b> is a politically charged adventure of swords, sorcery, vengeance, and the rise of sleeping giants.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Two continents at war, the Three Kingdoms and Ishara, are divided by past bloodshed. When an outside threat arises - the reawakening of a powerful ancient race that wants to remake the world - the two warring nations must somehow set aside generational hatreds and form an alliance to fight their true enemy.</p>";
