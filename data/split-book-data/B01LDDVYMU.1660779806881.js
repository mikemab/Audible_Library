window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this follow-up to the acclaimed military science fiction thriller <i>The Cold Between</i>, a young soldier finds herself caught in the crosshairs of a deadly conspiracy in deep space. </p> <p>Six weeks ago Commander Elena Shaw and Captain Greg Foster were court-martialed for their role in an event Central Gov denies ever happened. Yet instead of dishonorable discharges or time in a military prison, Shaw and Foster are now back together on <i>Galileo</i>. As punishment they've been assigned to patrol the nearly empty space of the Third Sector. </p> <p>But their mundane mission quickly turns treacherous when the <i>Galileo</i> picks up a distress call: <i>Exeter</i>, a sister ship, is under attack from raiders. A PSI generation ship - the same one that recently broke off negotiations with Foster - is also in the sector and joins in the desperate battle that leaves 97 of <i>Exeter</i>'s crew dead. </p> <p>An investigation of the disaster points to sabotage. And <i>Exeter </i>is only the beginning. When the PSI ship and <i>Galileo</i> suffer their own \"accidents\", it becomes clear that someone is willing to set off a war in the Third Sector to keep their secrets, and the clues point to the highest echelons of power and deep into Shaw's past. </p>";
