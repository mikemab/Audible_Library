window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Against all odds, Orah and Nathaniel have found the keep and revealed the truth about the darkness, initiating what they hoped would be a new age of enlightenment. But the people were more set in their ways than anticipated, and a faction of vicars whispered in their ears, urging a return to traditional ways. </p> <p>Desperate to keep their movement alive, Orah and Nathaniel cross the ocean to seek the living descendants of the keepmasters' kin. Those they find on the distant shore are both more and less advanced than expected. </p> <p>The seekers become caught between the two sides, and face the challenge of bringing them together to make a better world. The prize: a chance to bring home miracles and a more promising future for their people. But if they fail this time, they risk not a stoning but losing themselves in the twilight of a never-ending dream. </p> <p>Be sure to start with the first book in this series, the multiple award-winning <i>The Children of Darkness</i>. And don't miss David's award-winning speculative saga, <i>The Daughter of the Sea and the Sky</i>. </p>";
