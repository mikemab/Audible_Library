window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From acclaimed short-fiction star Suzanne Palmer comes an action-packed sci-fi caper that launches a high-stakes space adventure trilogy. </b></p> <p>Fergus Ferguson, repo-man, has one job: find the spacecraft <i>Venetia's Sword</i> and steal it back from Arum Gilger, ex-nobleman turned power-hungry trade boss. Finding Gilger in the farthest corner of human-inhabited space, a gas-giant harvesting colony called Cernee, was easy. The hard part will be getting past a field of space mines, hacking into the <i>Sword</i>'s compromised AI, and fighting a crew of hostile enemies to take control of the ship.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when a cable car explosion launches Cernee into a civil war, Fergus finds himself caught in the crosshairs. Repossessing the <i>Sword</i> requires him to side with Gilger's enemies, risk death, and get abducted by aliens. Fergus must learn to set aside his pride - and confront a past he's been running from his whole life - in order to take back the <i>Sword</i> and simultaneously save Cernee from destruction.</p>";
