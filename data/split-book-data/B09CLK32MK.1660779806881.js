window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No one ever said what would happen when dragons and aliens meet. And no one told me that I would be in the middle of it.</p> <p>Tasha was studying hard to get through her last year of university when she was kidnapped. She certainly did not expect to wake up with four feet and wings. Mad scientists are bad enough, but things get even more complicated when aliens appear and wipe out the human race. Is there a way for her to hide her true identity in this new world while retaining her humanity?&nbsp;</p> <p>Excerpt: Taking a deep breath, I jumped over the lip of the tray and beat down hard with my wings, expecting to only slow my fall. My powerful wingbeat plucked my feet from the sand as it threw me into the air. I squawked in surprise and spread my wings wide in alarm before gravity regained its hold on me. With several awkward back-winging motions of my wings, I landed lightly on the floor. Well, at least I know my wings work. I glanced at the man in the corner as he was scribbling quick notes. I turned around to regard the tray again. Well, they say practice makes perfect. With another hop and a single light wingbeat, I managed to land in the sand tray with fanned wings slowing my momentum. That was much more graceful. But a wing-assisted hop wasn’t true flight. And I still wasn’t on the windowsill.&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Word count: 113,600 words</li> </ul>";
