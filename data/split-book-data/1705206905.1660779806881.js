window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Peter finds himself on a strange planet, drafted into a war by alien abductors, his only goal is to be one of the few to survive the war and return home to Earth.</p> <p>Peter is one of thousands who get abducted every year, as payment to the aliens. The aliens have given humans portal travel, healing serums, and other advanced alien technology. The quality of life has improved, but everything has a price.</p> <p>Along with a group of strangers, Peter is trained for war by going up against literal monsters. The troll-like aliens won't give them modern weapons. Humans have to battle monsters with swords and shields, and that is just to get out of boot camp.</p> <p>His only chance to survive is to use the alien device he is given. The device can increase his strength and speed to superhuman levels. It can even grant him powers that seem like magic. Complicating things is that the device's interface is written in an ever-changing alien language. He will have to figure out its secrets if he wants to keep himself and his team alive.</p>";
