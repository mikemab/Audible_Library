window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"But what are we without dreams?\" </p> <p>A thousand years ago the Darkness came - a terrible time of violence, fear, and social collapse when technology ran rampant. But the vicars of the Temple of Light brought peace, ushering in an era of blessed simplicity. For 10 centuries they have kept the madness at bay with \"temple magic,\" and by eliminating forever the rush of progress that nearly caused the destruction of everything. </p> <p>Childhood friends Orah and Nathaniel have always lived in the tiny village of Little Pond, longing for more from life but unwilling to challenge the rigid status quo. When their friend Thomas returns from the Temple after his \"teaching\" - the secret coming-of-age ritual that binds young men and women eternally to the Light - they barely recognize the broken and brooding young man the boy has become. Then, when Orah is summoned as well, Nathaniel follows in a foolhardy attempt to save her. </p> <p>In the prisons of Temple City, they discover a terrible secret that launches the three on a journey to find the forbidden keep, placing their lives in jeopardy, for a truth from the past awaits that threatens the foundation of the Temple. If they reveal that truth, they might once again release the potential of their people. </p> <p>Yet they would also incur the Temple's wrath as it is written: \"If there comes among you a prophet saying, 'Let us return to the darkness,' you shall stone him, because he has sought to thrust you away from the Light.\" </p>";
