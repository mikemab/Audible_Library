Judged by a masked demigod, Tom gets sent to another world with magic, game-like rules, and massive opportunity for a clever inventor.</b></p> <p>He's been handed a new identity and adopted by a loving family. As a young man with otherworldly knowledge, he tries to recreate technology from humble beginnings. There are spells to learn, too, and he wants to treat his sister and parents right. His river homeland seems idyllic, but there are problems brewing with abused peasants, the necromancy business, and the management of living dungeons. To go from ambitious engineer to true hero, Tom needs to craft weapons, explore, and start a revolution.
