However, first, he must escape his father’s smothering presence.</p> <p>For Reia, a Ranger sworn to protect royals, the task of keeping the prince safe turns complicated when the fool runs away from his private guards.</p> <p>After an explosive meeting, the prince and the Ranger decide to travel together. Forces of nature and wild animals are expected dangers, but several predators come with political agendas. When Terosh’s attraction for his Ranger guardian becomes apparent, Reia becomes a pawn in a wider game.</p> <p>Even access to the fabled god-machines might fail to save them from having to answer a single question: what is one life measured against the fate of a planet?</p>";
