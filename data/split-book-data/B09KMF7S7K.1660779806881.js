For generations, the powerful families have pushed and pulled each other in a dance for dominance.</p> <p>Until a catastrophic betrayal from within changes everything.</p> <p>Now, deadly, disciplined, and solitary leaders Ramona Adler and Matias Baena must put aside their enmity and work together in secret to prevent sinister forces from exploiting universe-altering technology. Expecting to suffer through their uneasy alliance, Ramona and Matias instead discover that they understand each other as no one in their families can - and that their combined skills may eclipse the risks of their forbidden alliance.</p> <p>As the two warriors risk their lives to save their families, they must decide whether to resist or embrace the passion simmering between them. For now, the dance between their families continues - but just one misstep could spell the end of them both.</p>";
