window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It is current day, and everyone on earth believes that humans have only just begun to explore the stars. The truth is that humans left earth nearly 1,000 years ago to colonize other worlds. The oldest of the colonized worlds has come under the rule of an evil tyrant who desires to take the \"home-world\" for his own, so he sets out to conquer earth. Our hero, Blake Mitchell, is an average guy, a college student who hopes to someday develop video games. He and his sister Zoey are thrown into an incredible journey to save the earth from the evil tyrant. Along the way, they meet interesting and extraordinary people, discover new and exciting technologies, and engage in harrowing battles. Blake soon discovers that his involvement was no accident, but a carefully orchestrated plan that dates all the way back to his birth, and was all set into motion by his father.</p>";
