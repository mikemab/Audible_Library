window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the early 22nd century, humanity has spread through the solar system - and their electromagnetic signals have traveled hundreds of light years. An alien race called the Oghaldzon has decided that mankind is dangerously insane...and must be forcibly taken under control.&nbsp;</p> <p>The invasion fleet's technology is decades ahead of Earth's best. They have more ships than the human fleets combined, and a seemingly-inexhaustible number of ground troops. And they're not afraid to kill billions of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Humanity is outnumbered, outgunned, and divided. But they have a few cards left to play - and they're not going down without a fight.</p>";
