window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Meeting up with your fated lover after 3,000 years apart is not bad - at all. Having your ancient nemesis show up at the reunion party is no fun - at all.</b></p> <p>Helle may believe in second-chance love, but she sure doesn’t believe in reincarnation. Okay, she <i>didn’t</i> believe in stuff like that until she met Jason Morris a year or so ago. By now, she has accepted that sometimes impossible things are quite, quite possible - like an ancient princess being reborn as an ambitious financial analyst.</p> <p>Finding Jason was like finding the part of her that had always been missing - a perfect match. But handling Sam Woolf, the reborn version of their ancient nemesis, is something of a trial. No sooner do you have him well and surely beat, but up he bounces again. Sheesh, will it take an oak stake to permanently rid their lives of him?</p> <p>Sam Woolf is a powerful adversary. Too powerful, even. Jason and Helle will need help from unexpected quarters to finally bring this tangled, ancient love-and-hate triangle to some sort of conclusion. Question is, will they survive the experience?</p>";
