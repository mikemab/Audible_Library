window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The&nbsp;Last&nbsp;Man</i>&nbsp;is an apocalyptic, dystopian science-fiction novel by Mary Shelley that was first published in 1826. The book describes a future Earth at the time of the late 21st century, ravaged by an unknown pandemic that quickly sweeps across the world. It also includes a discussion of English culture as a republic, with Mary Shelley sitting in meetings of the House of Commons to gain an insight into the governmental political system of the Romantic era. Within the novel, she dedicates it highly to her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, who drowned in a shipwreck four years before the book’s publication. It is also dedicated to her dear friend Lord Byron who adored the Greek isles that were eventually his place of death.</p> <p><i>The&nbsp;Last&nbsp;Man</i>&nbsp;was severely suppressed at the time. It was not until the 1960s that the novel resurfaced for the public as a work of fiction, not prophesy. <i>The&nbsp;Last&nbsp;Man</i>&nbsp;is the first piece of dystopian fiction published, yet it is debated among literary critics whether <i>The&nbsp;Last&nbsp;Man</i>&nbsp;can be classed as a dystopian novel as it excludes political themes of repression and totalitarianism of the novels of later periods such as Orwell’s <i>1984</i> or Huxley’s <i>Brave New World</i>.</p>";
