Unfortunately, Amelia botches her audition and her dream comes crashing down—until the school agrees to give her a second chance. Amelia vows to do whatever it takes to make her dream come true.</p> <p>However, between a teacher who really dislikes her and a roommate who wants to see her expelled, Amelia has her hands full. On top of that, supernatural powers are threatening Mystwick, and Amelia might be the only person who can save the school…but only if she can remain true to herself.
