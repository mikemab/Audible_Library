window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Confederation is starting to collapse politically and economically, allowing the \"possessed\" to infiltrate more worlds. </p> <p>Quinn Dexter is loose on Earth, destroying the giant arcologies one at a time. As Louise Kavanagh tries to track him down, she manages to acquire some strange and powerful allies whose goal doesn't quite match her own. </p> <p>The campaign to liberate Mortonridge from the possessed degenerates into a horrendous land battle, the kind that hasn't been seen by humankind for 600 years; then some of the protagonists escape in a very unexpected direction. Joshua Calvert and Syrinx fly their starships on a mission to find the Sleeping God, which an alien race believes holds the key to overthrowing the possessed. </p> <p><i>The Naked God</i> is the brilliant climax to Peter F. Hamilton's awe-inspiring Night's Dawn trilogy. </p>";
