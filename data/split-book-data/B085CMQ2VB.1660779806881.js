Hired by a corporate client to secure an overdue product, he'll make some quick cryp and be on to the next job. Easy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Except, this job is anything but simple. The product is tied to the immensely powerful and ultra-secret Hypertek, leaving Blake with a choice: be a good soldier, or refuse to help MagnaCorp become the most powerful entity in the system.&nbsp;</p> <p>Another problem: everyone else in Concourse Prime is gunning for the product as well, from the demi-humans ruling its seedy underbelly to the CEOs inhabiting its gleaming superscrapers - people far more sinister than Hypertek.</p> <p>Blake fights to survive while he wrestles with his decision. In the end, itâ€™s just one big threat that could plunge humanity into an all-out interstellar conflict. What's the big deal?</p> <p>Don't miss <i>Hypertek</i> by <i>New York Times</i> best seller Mick Neilson, the first book in a thrilling cyberpunk series. It's perfect for fans of <i>Altered Carbon</i>, <i>Blade Runner</i>, and J.N. Chaney.&nbsp;</p>";
