window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To win the war, one man must break the rules of war. Because in the fight against the ruthless Sa’Nerran Empire, there is only victory or death.</b></p> <p>The Sa’Nerra were close to defeat, then everything changed. Armed with a unique neural weapon, the merciless alien warriors turned fleet crew against their own. Entire warships went rogue. Suspicion and fear ran riot.</p> <p>Victory now required new tactics and a new kind of ship and crew.</p> <p>Lucas Sterling is an Omega captain. He is the commander of the fleet, <i>Marauder Invictus</i>—an elite, black-ops warship that operates outside the rules of combat. Together with his crew of Omega officers—each chosen in a depraved and monstrous trial of grit and determination—Sterling will stop at nothing to beat the brutal Sa’Nerra. Even if that means killing fleet crew that have been “turned”. Even if that means killing the people he loves.</p> <p>They say space is cold, but the heart of an Omega captain is colder still...</p> <p>This special edition omnibus contains the final three books in the epic six-book Omega Taskforce military sci-fi series. If you like the sound of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> crossed with <i>Star Trek</i>'s Section 31, you'll love it. Enjoy ruthless alien warriors, running gun battles, devastating space combat, mystery, high-stakes action, and epic twists.</p> <p>Books included in the set:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Book Four: <i>Obsidian Fleet</i></li> <li>Book Five: <i>Dreadnaught</i></li> <li>Book Six: <i>The Vanguard</i></li> </ul>";
