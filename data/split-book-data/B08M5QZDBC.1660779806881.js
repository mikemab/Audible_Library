window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Wanted</i> is the 10th of a series of near future scifi/thrillers whose young heroine Ell Donsaii’s nerve mutation makes her a genius. It also provides astonishing athletic abilities. In <i>Wanted</i>, President Stockton continues her efforts to imprison Ell in order to protect the world from some of Ell’s dangerous new technology. While the President rightfully wants this technology to be restricted, she wants it to be controlled by the government. Ell doesn’t want even the government to have the terrible destructive potential of a technology that can cut through absolutely any material in the world! When the FBI and CIA prove to be unable to find and capture Ell, the President instructs them to imprison Ell’s friends. However, the President hasn’t considered just how many technological advantages Ell would have in her efforts to spring her friends from prison.</p>";
