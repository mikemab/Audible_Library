window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Telepath</i> is the fourth in a series of stories featuring the members of the Hyllis family. After a plague induced apocalypse collapsed civilization back to iron and horsepower, the Hyllises developed a genetic tendency to inherit “talents”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eva Hyllis and her ancestors became healers because their talents let them feel inside their patients. This helps them diagnose the underlying causes of many illnesses. Having made a diagnosis, sometimes they can do something. Unfortunately, often they cannot.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, Eva’s children Tarc and Daussie have inherited telekinetic and teleportation talents. Telekinetic pressure can stop bleeding and teleportation can remove stones and arterial plaques. In this book, they realize their young cousin Kazy’s a telepath!&nbsp;</p> <p>Tarc realizes his girlfriend Lizeth’s a precog…just before she breaks up with him. Now they’re rapidly finding more and more medical conditions their talents allow them to treat. And they discover an ancient, undisturbed medical facility which promises more equipment and knowledge. Perhaps Eva’s long held dream to teach and practice medicine full time might become possible?</p>";
