window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When we lost the American Rebellion against the British in the 1700s, the world for the colonists changed for the worst.</p> <p>After centuries of suffering under the oppressive thumb of the English crown, a wealthy American entrepreneur in the 21st century finds an alien craft that can travel through time.</p> <p>That man is my best friend. And he figured out how to use that alien tech with one goal in mind: to go back in time and use our modern technology and knowledge to help the American colonists defeat the English, with their Revolutionary War, and change the course of history for the better.</p> <p>And why does he ask me, a lowly, disgraced former police officer, to be the one to make this precarious journey and try to change history?</p> <p>Because after a British official murdered my wife and got away with it, I have nothing left to lose.</p> <p>This way, even if I don't make it back, the course of time will have changed and maybe, just maybe, in the new future I can help shape, America might be a free country and the woman who would have been my wife would be alive.</p> <p>Those two aspirations are worth fighting for.</p> <p>I only hope I can achieve the impossible and change America's future by going into the past.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Second Chance </i>is the first book in the Second Chance series, an alternate American Revolutionary War retelling.
