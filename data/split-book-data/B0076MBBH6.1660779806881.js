window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Award-winning author, narrator, and screenwriter Neil Gaiman personally selected this book, and, using the tools of the Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX), worked with the book's author to cast the narrator and produced this work for his audiobook label, Neil Gaiman Presents. </b></p> <p><b>A few words from Neil on <i>White Apples:</i></b> \"In his performance, Victor Bevine manages to convey three aspects of Vincent’s personality: the womanizing hedonist he was in life, the now-dead fellow trying to control his rising panic who realizes his one-night-stand knows today is his mother’s birthday; and, ultimately, the loving, heroic family man who undertakes a big task for the sake of his unborn son and - incidentally - the rest of humanity. That’s a tall order for any narrator, but I wasn’t surprised when the accomplished actor Victor Bevine made the character come alive.” </p> <p>Vincent Ettrich, a genial philanderer, discovers he has died and come back to life, but he has no idea why, or what the experience was like. Gradually, he discovers he was brought back by his true love, Isabelle, because she is pregnant with their child - a child who, if raised correctly, will play a crucial role in saving the universe. </p> <p>But to be brought up right, the child must learn what Vincent learned on the other side - if only Vincent can remember it. On a father’s love and struggle may depend the future of everything that is. </p> <p>By turns quirky, romantic, awesome, and irresistible, <i>White Apples</i> is a tale of love, fatherhood, death, and life that will leave you seeing the world with new eyes.</p>";
