She treats the undead for a host of ills - vocal strain in banshees, arthritis in barrow-wights, and entropy in mummies. </p> <p>It's a quiet, supernatural-adjacent life until a sect of murderous monks emerges, killing human and undead Londoners alike. As terror takes hold of the city, Greta must use her unusual skills to stop the cult if she hopes to save her practice - and her life. </p>";
