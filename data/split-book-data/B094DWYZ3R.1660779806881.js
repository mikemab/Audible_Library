window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The sport of dungeoneering is the dungeon-crawling game genre turned into live reality television, where anyone can die, the stakes are high, and anything can happen. </b></p> <p>Mei Sky, the orphaned daughter of a famous dungeoneer, takes on a little too much debt with the elvish mafia. She did it in order to get her sister into a singing audition. Now her sister is in danger of being sold into slavery. Mei does the only thing she can in her situation - she brings up her father's name while bargaining with the elven debt collector.&nbsp;</p> <p>The thug is intrigued. He waives her debt, for the moment, for the promise of a grand prize: the Blue Diamond. The entry price is steep. But Mei is determined. Will she win the dungeoneering game, on national television, and save her sister? Or will she go the way her father went: dead because of his ambitions?</p>";
