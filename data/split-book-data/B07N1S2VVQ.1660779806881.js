She has worked for two kings and two regents, has seen two royal families murdered through magic, has seen ghosts and demons, and kept her head down like a good girl.</p> <p>On her 50th birthday, she receives her late father’s diary, which describes a magical item&nbsp;that is so evil it needs to be kept in the church crypt: a box&nbsp;that contains dragon.</p> <p>Problem is someone has stolen the box.</p> <p>Regent Bernard holds a banquet for his eldest son’s 60th birthday. Distinguished guests come from far and wide. Because she knows what the box looks like, Nellie discovers it in a nobleman's luggage. Removing the box from a thief’s room is not stealing, right?

Nellie's friend in the church&nbsp;advises Nellie to flee with the dragon box. The Regent is on a mission to stamp out magic, and Nellie plans to do what she does best: Keep her head down and hide.</p> <p>Problem is the dragon has other ideas.</p>";
