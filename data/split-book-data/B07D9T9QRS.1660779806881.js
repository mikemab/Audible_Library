window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The complete first trilogy. Three books. </b></p> <p><i>Rath's Deception - </i>On the cutthroat streets of Tarkis, orphaned teens like Rath end up&nbsp;jailed … or dead. So when the shadowy Janus Group offers&nbsp;Rath&nbsp;a chance to earn riches beyond his wildest dreams,&nbsp;he&nbsp;seizes it. But the Janus Group is as ruthless as the elite assassins it controls.&nbsp;Rath will&nbsp;have to survive their grueling, off-world training, and&nbsp;fulfill all 50 kills in his contract&nbsp;before&nbsp;a single cent&nbsp;comes his way.&nbsp;And ending so many lives comes with a price Rath can't anticipate. It'll&nbsp;certainly cost him what's left of his innocence. It may&nbsp;well&nbsp;cost him his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Rath's Gambit </i>- Rath just assassinated a senator, and completed his final mission for the Janus Group. Now every Interstellar Police officer on Alberon is searching for him. If they don't find him,&nbsp;one of his fellow&nbsp;contractors&nbsp;certainly will … and the most feared criminal organization in the galaxy has severe punishments for employees who break the&nbsp;rules. Rath's only hope is to find the rogue contractor&nbsp;who helped him escape&nbsp;a company deathtrap after his final mission. United, the two assassins might just&nbsp;get&nbsp;free from the Janus Group&nbsp;and get what they're owed. But first they'll need to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Rath's Reckoning</i> - Rath&nbsp;and Paisen&nbsp;completed all 50 kills in&nbsp;their&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;with the Janus Group.&nbsp;But when&nbsp;they&nbsp;uncovered the criminal organization's darkest secret,&nbsp;the Janus Group&nbsp;unleashed an army of assassins to silence&nbsp;the rogue pair. With help from a former Interstellar Police detective, Rath&nbsp;and Paisen&nbsp;survive&nbsp;- barely.&nbsp;</p>";
