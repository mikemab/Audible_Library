window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>D’Lean, a member of a long-forgotten order of magical monks, believes something has gone wrong with the Prophecy of Return. A prophecy that would give hope back to the people against the evil of the dragon king Marcus the Red.</p> <p>However, upon the capturing of Balor, the king's brother, he finds out the truth and so much more. The prophecy has indeed been broken, plus the king is breeding half-breed abominations for a vile purpose.</p> <p>Soon D’Lean, a redeemed Balor, and Laurana, the first female monk in thousands of years, set out to give life to the broken prophecy. Along the way, they gather together a group of unlikely help: Mara, a thief that can’t help her wandering hands; Hayden, a boy and would-be knight; and Thrace and Na'Resse, two twins, a brother and a sister born into slavery.</p> <p>Will their bonds of friendship and love be enough to overcome thousands of years of oppression and hate, or will the darkness emerge and destroy the world?</p>";
