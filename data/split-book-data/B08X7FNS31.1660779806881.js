window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Psychicians</i> by Laurence E. Dahners&nbsp;</p> <p>This tale of psychic-physicians is the fifth in a series of stories featuring the psychically talented members of the Hyllis family.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hundreds of years after a plague-induced apocalypse collapsed civilization back to iron and horsepower, the Hyllises have a genetic tendency to inherit “talents”. Eva Hyllis and her ancestors became healers because their talents let them feel inside their patients. This helped them diagnose the underlying causes of many illnesses.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eva’s children Tarc and Daussie have inherited telekinetic and teleportation talents. Their cousin Kazy’s a telepath. Telekinetic pressure can stop bleeding, teleportation can remove arterial plaques, and telepathy can provide anesthesia and correct psychopathy.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this audiobook, they keep finding more and more medical conditions their talents allow them to treat. And, it turns out that the dye chemists in their new town are good enough to synthesize chemicals as complex as antibiotics.</p> <p>Eva’s long-held dream of teaching and practicing medicine full time is coming true!</p>";
