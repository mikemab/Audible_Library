window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Published in six volumes between 1776 and 1781, <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire </i>- for all its renown - can be intimidating. It contains one point five million words, an estimated 8,000 footnotes, a cast of 10,000 historical figures, and a timeline of more than 1,000 years. Yet even today, Gibbon's historical chronicle demands to be understood. </p> <p>These 24 lectures invite you on a riveting examination of this great work as a vast historical chronicle, a compelling masterpiece of literature, a sharp commentary on cultural mores, and a cautionary tale to Enlightenment Europe. In this chapter-by-chapter guide to the <i>Decline and Fall</i>, Professor Damrosch helps you navigate the book's themes, structure, and lasting influence. </p> <p>You'll approach the <i>Decline and Fall</i> as a written work whose footnotes, periodic style, and historical blind spots reflect the styles and ideologies of the Enlightenment age in which it was written. And for those intimidated by its thousands of pages or who feel they may lack the time to fully appreciate Gibbon's narrative of how Rome fell to \"barbarism and religion\", these lectures offer a richly detailed overview of what Gibbon called \"many of the events most interesting in human annals\", including: the reign of the Antonines, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the codification of Roman law, the Crusades, and the dawn of medieval Europe. </p> <p>Whether you've read the <i>Decline and Fall</i> before or whether you've always wanted to read it but never knew where to start, Professor Damrosch's lectures are an authoritative guide to a once-mighty empire - and the great book that became its classic eulogy and epitaph. </p>";
