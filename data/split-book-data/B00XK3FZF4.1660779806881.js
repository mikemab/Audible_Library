window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the tradition of Roger Zelazny's classic Amber novels, the second volume of Charles Stross' thrill-a-minute saga of multiple worlds.&nbsp;</p> <p>Miriam, a hip tech journalist from Boston, discovered her alternate world relatives in <i>The Family Trade</i> and with them an elite identity she didn't know was hers. Now, in order to avoid a slippery slope down to an unmarked grave, Miriam, known as Lady Helge to the Family, starts applying modern business practices and scientific knowledge to a trade dominated by mercantilists - with unexpected consequences for three different timelines, including the quasi-Victorian one exploited by the hidden family.&nbsp;</p> <p>Charles Stross is one of the big new SF writers of the 21st century, and the saga of The Merchant Princes is his most ambitious work yet.&nbsp;</p>";
