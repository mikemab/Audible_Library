window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Callum had seen things all his life. There are monsters and beasts living among people, but he learned very early not to admit such things, not if he didn’t want people to think him crazy.&nbsp;</p> <p>It turns out that the supernatural is real, but at 30, Callum has no desire to be part of that secret. Not that he has a choice when it turns out he is a mage, albeit one that hasn’t cast any spells in all his life. There are requirements, duties, and education that the powers that be insist he be subject to.</p> <p>To hell with that.</p> <p><b>An urban fantasy and magical realism story with a healthy dash of genre subversion.</b></p> <p><b>Voted Best Ongoing on Royal Road!</b></p>";
