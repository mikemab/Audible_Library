Where would you turn if you had uncovered something so shocking that it could force the entire world to readdress its views of humanity? Gada has always asked questions that no one has the answers for. Only through her studies has she met professors and teachers who are open-minded enough to consider her theories about the true history of humanity.</p> <p>As a high school student, her ideas are dismissed by others as the ramblings of an overactive teenage mind, but when she joins the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), she is suddenly thrust into a world where secret information is the norm. A chance conversation with a theoretical science professor provides Gada with what she sees as proof that her theories about the origins of humanity are not quite as crazy as she has been told. What if evolution and divine intervention are not opposing theories, but rather two sides of the same coin? What if everything we believed about our Universe was completely wrong? Along with her childhood sweetheart, Mike, Gada is about to embark upon a journey in which she will be forced to risk everything to uncover the truth—not least of all her safety and that of her family.&nbsp;</p> <p>Inside <i>Niobium Node</i>, you will uncover:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>The convergence of theories surrounding the origins of humanity and how each theory has merit, but we are just missing the final piece of that puzzle</li> <li>How one young woman with the right idea can change the course of humanity forever</li> <li>The truth behind the work of major conglomerates, and how even analytical research can be guided by an unseen hand</li> <li>How free will is not what we think it is, and perhaps we have just been puppets all along</li> </ul> <p>The story of Gada’s discovery and her ongoing quest to expose the truth will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew to be true.
