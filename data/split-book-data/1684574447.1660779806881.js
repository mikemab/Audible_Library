window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Sooner or Later Everything Falls into the Sea</i> is one of the most anticipated science fiction and fantasy collections of recent years. Pinsker has shot like a star across the firmament with stories multiply nominated for awards as well as Sturgeon and Nebula Award wins.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the baker's dozen stories gathered here, listeners travel to the past and future, and explore the weirder points of the present. The journey is the thing as Pinsker weaves music, memory, technology, history, mystery, love, loss, and even multiple selves on generation ships and cruise ships, on highways and high seas, in murder houses and tree houses. They feature runaways, fiddle-playing astronauts, and retired time travelers; they are weird, wired, hopeful, haunting, and deeply human.</p>";
