window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dr. Neil Anson Clemons was born at the very moment that men first landed on the moon and always strived to become an astronaut and reach the stars. Neil devoted his life to staying physically fit as any astronaut should be through martial arts and mentally fit by studying and becoming one of the world's foremost experts in quantum physics and gravitational theory. Now he and his team have achieved a breakthrough, both in building a warp drive, and finding a new energy source powerful enough to make the drive more than an interesting theoretical concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of attractive and outspoken southern astronaut, US Air Force Colonel Tabitha Ames, the US Government is convinced to fund the Top Secret warp project, including assembly in orbit of the first faster-than-light probe. Unfortunately, forces working behind the scenes have much darker dreams, and have infiltrated the Top Secret program. They do not hesitate to blow up a space shuttle, attempt to kill Neil and Tabitha, and use the stolen warp technology to start what they expect to be a short, devastating, and victorious war with the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But Dr. Clemons has ideas for using his warp drive technology completely unsuspected by America's enemies, and repelling the all-out attack is only the beginning of a titanic struggle to reach the stars.</p>";
