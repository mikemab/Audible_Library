And they’re betting everything that you’ll say yes, too.&nbsp;Welcome to The Future: a computer that connects to the internet one year from now, so you can see who you’ll be dating, where you’ll&nbsp;be&nbsp;working, even whether or not you’ll be alive in the year to come.&nbsp;By forming a startup to deliver this revolutionary technology to the world, Ben and Adhi have made their wildest, most impossible dream a reality. Once Silicon Valley outsiders, they’re now its hottest commodity.&nbsp;</p> <p>The device can predict everything perfectly - from stock market spikes and sports scores to political scandals and corporate takeovers - allowing them to chase down success and fame while staying one step ahead of the competition.&nbsp;But the future their device foretells is not the bright one they imagined.</p> <p>Ambition. Greed. Jealousy. And, perhaps, an apocalypse.&nbsp;The question is...can they stop it?</p> <p>Told through emails, texts, transcripts, and blog posts, this bleeding-edge tech&nbsp;thriller chronicles the costs of innovation and asks how far you’d go to protect the ones you love - even from themselves.</p>";
