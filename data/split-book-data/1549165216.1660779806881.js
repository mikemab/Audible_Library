window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The acclaimed actor’s shockingly prescient novel of speculative fiction “presents a near-future United States torn apart by civil war and deep racial strife” (</b><b><i>Tampa Bay Times</i></b><b>). For the first time ever, available as an audiobook read by the author.</b></p> <p>America today is teetering on the edge of the alarming vision presented in LeVar Burton’s debut novel, written more than two decades ago....&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2012, the first African American president is assassinated by a White extremist - just four days after he is elected. The horrific tragedy leads to riots, financial collapse, and ultimately, a full-on civil war. In its aftermath, millions are left homeless as famine and disease spread throughout the country.</p> <p>But from Chicago, a mysterious voice cries out....</p> <p>To Leon Crane, a former NASA scientist now struggling to survive on the streets, the pleas he hears remind him of the wife he could not save - and offer him a chance at redemption.</p> <p>To Jacob Fire Cloud, a revered Lakota medicine man, the voice is a sign that the White Buffalo Woman has returned to unite all the races in peace and prosperity.</p> <p>And to little Amy Ladue, the cries are those of her mother, who disappeared during the devastating St. Louis earthquake - and who must still be alive.</p> <p>These three strangers will be drawn together to rescue someone they have never met, a woman who holds the key to a new future for humanity - one remarkably brimming with hope.</p> <p>“LeVar Burton brings a strong new voice to science fiction with this powerful, even disturbing, novel.” (Ben Bova, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author)</p> <p>“An amazingly good first novel.” (<i>Rocky Mountain News</i>)</p> <p>“I highly recommend this book!” (Whoopi Goldberg)</p>";
