window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A writer turned barbarian.</b></p> <p><b>A human turned spellbook.</b></p> <p><b>A tower that's going to kill them both if they don't band together.</b></p> <p><b>My name is Randy—the noun, not the adjective.</b></p> <p>As a professional writer and accidental barbarian, I should be a prime candidate to be portaled to a LitRPG fantasy world known as Genera. It should be a no-brainer for me to grab the nearest weapon and start slaying bloodthirsty goblins, gaining levels, solving puzzles, and fighting my way to the top of a mysterious tower with seven distinct floors.</p> <p>Technically, I was born for this $#!%.</p> <p>Or so I thought....</p> <p>Unlike actual video games, if someone dies here in Genera, they die here for good. And I don't want to die. Not only that, the challenges are sudden and unpredictable, and wizards and other players seem dead-set on sending me to an early grave.</p> <p>So I do what any writer-turned-barbarian in a fantasy world does—I find someone to team up with. A guild of sorts. Only my new partner-in-crime isn't a person. He's a magical spellbook named Clovis. And while he has many flaws, Clovis may just be the ticket to <i>both </i>of us surviving this mad challenge.</p> <p>So in a way, this is sort of a LitRPG buddy comedy about two players forced to get good or die trying. But it's also an action-packed true story about my journey through a fascinating new world with surprises around every corner, one that you will have to hear to believe....</p> <p><b>About the series:</b></p> <p><b><i>Tokens and Towers</i></b><b> is from Amazon best seller Harmon Cooper, author of </b><b><i>Monster Hunt NYC</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Feedback Loop</i></b><b>. This is Harmon's </b><b><i>seventh </i></b><b>LitRPG series, one jam-packed with genre Easter eggs, fantasy tropes turned upside down, a ton of heart, and a </b><b><i>John Wick</i></b><b>'s worth of action.</b></p>";
