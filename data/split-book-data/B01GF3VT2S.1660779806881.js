With another election on the horizon, the Supermajority is in tight contention, and everything's on the line. </p> <p>With power comes corruption. For Ken, this is his chance to do right by the idealistic Policy1st party and get a steady job in the big leagues. For Domaine, the election represents another staging ground in his ongoing struggle against the pax democratica. For Mishima, a dangerous Information operative, the whole situation is a puzzle: How do you keep the wheels running on the biggest political experiment of all time when so many have so much to gain? </p> <p><i>Infomocracy</i> is Malka Older's debut novel. </p>";
