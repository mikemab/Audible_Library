She is furious to learn that on this island teetering on the brink of civil war, women are chattel. The 16th-century Spaniards want to lock her in a tower. The 14th- century pirates want to enslave her. The Inca Indians would worship her as a god. The World War II soldiers aren't sure what to make of her. None of them are ready for a modern woman.</p>";
