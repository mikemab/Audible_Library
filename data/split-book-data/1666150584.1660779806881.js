window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>No Honor in Death</i>: Will a jinxed starship with a demoralized crew find death, or will it find glory? Siobhan Dunmoore was not having a good war. She's had more ships shot out from under her by the invading Shrehari Empire than any other officer in the Fleet. Failure was not an option, and defeat not an acceptable alternative, for there was no honor in death, only in victory. She would redeem herself and her ship or be damned for all eternity.</p> <p><i>The Path of Duty</i>: When you can no longer trust your own side, where do you turn? In the midst of competing schemes for supremacy, fending off marauders, mercenaries, and spies, Dunmoore had to find a way to get her people home safe and beyond the reach of powerful cabals that had burrowed their way deep into the heart of the Admiralty. If her ship was to survive, she had to find the path of duty, no matter the personal cost, even if the price she had to pay was her own existence.</p> <p><i>Like Stars in Heaven</i>: One last mission. One mysterious passenger. One baffling destination. After centuries of travel, an ancient log buoy finally reaches human-controlled space. Though her troubles quickly multiply, Dunmoore has faced worse odds. She's determined to bring Stingray home with its honor intact, and few are brave enough to bet against her, not even their old Shrehari foes.</p>";
