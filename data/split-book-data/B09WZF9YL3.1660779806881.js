window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Empire is dead!</p> <p>And Captain Josiah Bleys, smuggler and charmer though he may be, is likely to soon follow unless he is willing to at least pretend to be something he loathes: a hero. His \"pal\" Chief Ragnar Kane, one of the Emperor's finest warriors, likewise harbors no aspirations toward gallantry, just increasing his kill count.</p> <p>Fate, however, has other plans. The mighty galaxy-spanning Terran Empire is mortally wounded, brought to its knees by a terrifying intelligent plague from hyperspace. The core worlds are mass graves, and the government lies in ruins. Outlying colonies, suddenly isolated and without support, are on their own.</p> <p>Luck (the bad kind) has both men stuck on the icy mining facility on Cerberus, an installation that won't last long without resupply. Bleys and Kane must mount a daring raid on a neighboring planet to retrieve a legendary scientist in the hopes that he can reconnect them to civilization, or they and everyone else at their frozen outpost are doomed.</p> <p>The trouble is that the scientist isn't exactly willing, nor is he exactly . . . alive.</p>";
