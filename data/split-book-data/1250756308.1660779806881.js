window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Mongrel Mage</i></b><b>, L. E. Modesitt, Jr.'s </b><b><i>Quantum Shadows</i></b><b> blends science fiction, myth, and legend in an adventure that pits old gods and new against one another in a far-future world.</b></p> <p>On a world called Heaven, the 10 major religions of mankind each have its own land governed by a capital city and ruled by a Hegemon. That Hegemon may be a god, or a prophet of a god. Smaller religions have their own towns or villages of belief.</p> <p>Corvyn, known as the Shadow of the Raven, contains the collective memory of humanityâ€™s Falls from Grace. With this knowledge comes enormous power.</p> <p>When unknown power burns a mysterious black image into the holy place of each House of the Decalivre, Corvyn must discover what entity could possibly have that much power. The stakes are nothing less than another Fall, and if he doesn't stop it, mankind will not rise from the ashes.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books </b></p>";
