window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Prophecy. Fate. Destiny. Augury.&nbsp;</p> <p>Words that promise a chosen one will rise to protect the downtrodden...or avenge them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many cultures believe in their champions; heroes are desperately needed now. The oppressive, technologically advanced Corlain Empire ravages the weak people of Glostaimia; the \"acceptable\" cultures are forced to assimilate. Two powerful, and utterly disparate, crusaders emerge to oppose Corla.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two Dogs has trained his entire life in protector magic. Circumstances suggest he's the hero of legend, but Two Dogs is the master of his own actions. With a tomahawk in one hand and a knife in the other, he'll prove why it was wrong to start a fight with the Lacreechee tribe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Princess Murid has more reason to hate the Corlains than most. She's been groomed since childhood on her duties as the chosen one, but not even her royal status can convince those who adopted her that the Corlains will soon come to claim their land and resources as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can native magic and barbarian ingenuity combine to overcome a superior foe when both sides hold onto their dogmatic views about fate? Who's the real chosen one?\"</p>";
