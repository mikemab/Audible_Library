window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>American Gods</i> meets <i>The Dark Tower</i> in a dark, contemporary fantasy of the open road, alternate realities, and self-discovery, from a Locus-nominated and Hugo and Nebula Award-winning writer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ten years ago, Zelda led a band of merry adventurers whose knacks let them travel to alternate realities and battle the black rot that threatened to unmake each world. Zelda was the warrior; Ish could locate people anywhere; Ramon always knew what path to take; Sarah could turn catastrophe aside. Keeping them all connected: Sal, Zelda’s lover and the group's heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Until their final, failed mission, when Sal was lost. When they all fell apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Ten years on, Ish, Ramon, and Sarah are happy and successful. Zelda is alone, always traveling, destroying rot throughout the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When it boils through the crack in the Liberty Bell, the rot gives Zelda proof that Sal is alive, trapped somewhere in the alts. Zelda’s getting the band back together - plus Sal’s young cousin June, who has a knack none of them have ever seen before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As relationships rekindle, the friends begin to believe they can find Sal and heal all the worlds. It’s not going to be easy, but they’ve faced worse before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But things have changed, out there in the alts. And in everyone's hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Fresh from winning the Hugo and Nebula Awards, Max Gladstone weaves elements of American myth - the muscle car, the open road, the white-hatted cowboy - into a deeply emotional tale where his characters must find their own truths if they are to survive.</p>";
