window.bookSummaryJSON = "The irreverent author of the cult classic <i>Syrup</i> hits his target in this satire on the wages of big capital.

When lowly Merchandising Officer Hack Nike unwittingly signs a contract that involves shooting teenagers to build up street credibility for Nike's new line of $2,500 sneakers, he goes to The Police, only to be pursued by Jennifer Government, a tough-talking agent with a bar-code tattoo under her eye, the consumer watchdog from hell.";
