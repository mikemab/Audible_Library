window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What do you desire in exchange for your soul? Everlasting youth? A million dollars? Women? Power?</b></p> <p>Bored high-schooler Adam Staples wants for nothing. Such an offer could only be a prank, right? Who would have thought that the prankster is a demon in disguise?</p> <p>After selling his soul and turning into a half-demon, Adam finds himself orphaned and dragged into a realm outside of the world he knew. Training under his benefactor and enrolling in a school made for those who were gifted with powers, Adam ventures around the Outworld to hunt down the demon that turned his life inside out...and perhaps to squash a bit of the guilt he carries for what he had done to his family.</p>";
