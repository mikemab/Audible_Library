window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After having been trapped in his office for 10,000 years, Lacerto, the god of small to medium-sized lizards, escapes to seek revenge. They say when you go looking for revenge, dig two graves. If you're a god, make sure one of them is the size of Mount Olympus. To keep himself out of that grave, Lacerto will have to win and wield a divine weapon that takes the form of a brutally sarcastic salamander, take on the entire pantheon of gods, and control a human lawyer to whom he accidentally assigned godlike power when she became his pope. But at least there will be alcohol. And snark. </p>";
