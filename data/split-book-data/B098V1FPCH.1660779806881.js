window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A \"prehistorical-fiction\" novel about a boy prodigy in a primitive caveman society. First he reduces a dislocation of his own finger, then works out how to \"set bones\" for others who’re injured. Like Jean Auel's Ayla, he discovers other primitive technologies, including trapping, smoking meat, and the domestication of a wolf. His mastery of these skills gradually elevates his previously despised and downtrodden position in their society - until he becomes highly respected and admired. And, falls in love with the girl he didn’t dream could love him back....</p>";
