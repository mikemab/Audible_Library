window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book Three by international writing phenomenon David Weber. Two young settlers on a pioneer planet seeks to stop a war and to save the intelligent alien treecats from exploitation by unscrupulous humans. </p> <p>The fires are out, but the trouble’s just beginning for the treecats. </p> <p>On pioneer planet Sphinx, ruined lands and the approach of winter force the now Landless Clan to seek new territory. They have one big problem - there’s nowhere to go. Worse, their efforts to find a new home awaken the enmity of the closest treecat clan - a stronger group who’s not giving up a single branch without a fight. </p> <p>Stephanie Harrington, the treecats’ greatest advocate, is off to Manticore for extensive training - and up to her ears in challenges there. That leaves only Stephanie’s best friends, Jessica and Anders, to save the treecats from themselves. And now a group of xenoanthropologists is once again after the great secret of the treecats - that they are intelligent, empathic telepaths - and their agenda will lead to nothing less that treecat exploitation. </p> <p>Finally, Jessica and Anders face problems of their own, including their growing attraction to each other. It is an attraction that seems a betrayal of Stephanie Harrington, the best friend either of them have ever had.</p>";
