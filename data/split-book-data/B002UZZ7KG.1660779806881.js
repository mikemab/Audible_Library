window.bookSummaryJSON = "Deep within Syndicate Worlds' space, the Alliance fleet continues its dangerous journey home under the command of Captain John \"Black Jack\" Geary, who was revived after a century spent in suspended animation. Geary's victories over the enemy have earned him both the respect and the envy of his fellow officers. <p>Geary has made many risky decisions as commander, especially in ordering the Alliance fleet back to the Lakota Star System, where it was nearly destroyed by the Syndics. It's a desperate gamble that may buy Geary just enough time to prepare for the Syndics' inevitable return, and give the fleet a fighting chance at survival.</p> <p>But even as he struggles to stay one step ahead of the enemy, Geary must face conspirators within his own fleet who want a change of command and are willing to do anything to bring it about. Geary knows that his fleet must stand together or the Syndic forces will tear them apart.</p> <p>BONUS AUDIO: Author Jack Campbell explains why he sees <i>Valiant</i> as the latest in a long tradition of \"sea stories\".</p>";
