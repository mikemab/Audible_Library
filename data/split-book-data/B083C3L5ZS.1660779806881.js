window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sandra managed to survive the first major incursion from the nearby Orcs, thanks in part to the help a certain half-orc/half-dwarf provided. However, Kelerim left her dungeon to seek out his father, leaving her all alone with just Winxa - her dungeon fairy - as company.</p> <p>With the loss of her new friend comes some opportunities, at least; she now has the freedom to craft whatever she wants, and the threat of her dungeon core’s destruction from outside forces is practically absent. She even has the opportunity to upgrade her core size, unlocking additional constructs for use as dungeon monsters, as well as a new core-specific skill.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Sandra, a particular action outside of the dungeon has unintentionally drawn attention to her activities, and there’s now a very serious threat to her survival. Racing against the clock, the crafting-based dungeon needs to find a way to prevent her destruction, all the while dealing with the problems her expanding area of influence has created.</p> <p>Because it’s not only the nearby races that she has to deal with - but the nearby dungeons, as well.</p> <p><b>This dungeon core story contains litRPG/gamelit elements such as statistics and leveling and a heavy crafting emphasis. No profanity and no harems.</b></p>";
