window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Vincent Bugliosi turns his critical eye on both religious believers and the atheists who reflexively oppose them. Here he indicts both camps and argues that agnosticism is the most responsible position to take with regard to such eternal questions as the existence of God. Bugliosi examines such developments as the decline of belief in evolution and the disturbing vengefulness of God, as depicted in the Old Testament. He also questions that an all-powerful and all-knowing creator would have so badly miscalculated free will, leaving human beings to persecute and murder each other. Vincent Bugliosi sets a new course - a middle path that urges us to recognize the limits of what we know, and what we cannot know, about the ineffable mysteries of existence.</p>";
