window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Trapped 1,300 years in the past, they have one mission: survive.</p> <p>In the 23rd century, humanity has been hunted to the verge of extinction by an alien race. When an exploratory ship accidentally travels back in time to Viking-age Scandinavia, the human race is given a second chance. Pursued by the power-hungry King Harald, the four surviving crew members join a ragtag band of Vikings as they pillage their way across Europe. It will take all their ingenuity, courage, and technical know-how just to survive. But survival is only the beginning. To save humanity, they must somehow return to the stars.</p> <p>Thus begins a decades-long effort to teach the Vikings to build a craft capable of reaching space - a ship that will come to be known as the <i>Iron Dragon</i>.</p> <p><i>The Dream of the Iron Dragon</i> is the first installment in the Iron Dragon trilogy. The sequel, <i>The Dawn of the Iron Dragon</i>, was released in June 2018. The saga will conclude with <i>The Voyage of the Iron Dragon</i> in December 2018.</p> <p>The Iron Dragon trilogy is being produced as part of the phenomenally successful Saga of the Iron Dragon Kickstarter, which raised more than $10,000. Meticulously researched and packed with action, <i>The Dream of the Iron Dragon</i> is a must for sci-fi and alternate history fans.</p>";
