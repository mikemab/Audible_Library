window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A lost city.</b></p> <p><b>An ill-fated historical expedition.</b></p> <p><b>A modern day quest for one of history’s most enduring legends….</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the onset of the Second World War, Nazi Germany sends a multipurpose expedition to Antarctica. Not all of its members return.&nbsp;</p> <p>Today in Egypt, hushed whispers in a Cairo bar hint of a long-lost second Sphinx hidden beneath the sands of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Boozy talk of a map therein to the lost city of Atlantis convinces a ragtag band of local tour guides with mixed motives to take matters into their own hands. To find out if the rumors are true, without going through proper archaeological channels, they hastily descend beneath the traditional landmarks they think they know so well.&nbsp;</p> <p>When complacence bred by their familiarity leads them to a place much darker than expected—both literally and figuratively—the surviving explorers are thrust into a perilous journey spanning the blistering sands of Egypt to the frigid ice of Antarctica as they search for physical proof of the legendary society.&nbsp;</p> <p>But as they follow an astonishing and deadly trail of clues, funded by an enigmatic and dangerously unpredictable Arab billionaire, the adventurers discover that Atlantis harbors secrets beyond its mere location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Atlantis, to this day, has guardians. And they are not human.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
