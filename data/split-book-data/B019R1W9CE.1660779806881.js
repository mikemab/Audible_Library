window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first great war of Ovira is over, and the most hated king in centuries is dead, but his nephew still lives. However, Basen had nothing to do with the destructive war his uncle started. In fact it was his uncle who exiled him and his father to the territory of their enemies, where Basen's dreams of becoming a legendary mage now fade, as he must work all day just to eat. His only chance at regaining some semblance of the life he thought he would lead is to join an elite school that trains, houses, and feeds a thousand new young men and women each year. But little does Basen know that his determination will put him at the center of a war even bloodier than the one he'd barely managed to avoid. </p>";
