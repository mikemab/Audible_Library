window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here are two bestselling novels which offer a great introduction to the Kings and Sorcerers series. Kings and Sorcerers tells the epic coming of age story of Kyra, 15, who dreams of becoming a famed warrior, like her father, though she is the only girl in a fort of boys. She struggles to understand her special skills and mysterious inner power, and comes to realize she is different than the others.</p> <p>But a secret is being kept from her about her birth and the prophecy surrounding her, leaving her only to wonder. When Kyra comes of age and her father tries to wed her off, she refuses and journeys out on her own, into a dangerous wood, where she encounters a wounded dragonâ€”and ignites a series of events that will change the kingdom forever.</p> <p>With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, Kings and Sorcerers is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons. It is a story of love and broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is fantasy at its finest, inviting us into a world that will live with us forever, one that will appeal to all ages and genders.</p>";
