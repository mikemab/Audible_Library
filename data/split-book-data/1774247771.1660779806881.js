They were wrong.</b></p> <p>Inside a dystopian school in the Singularity, the 12-year-old girl known as One Twenty-Four struggles to survive. Failure to conform means death at the hands of her teacher. Assuming her clone sisters don't kill her first.</p> <p>The Terran Empire has tasked Imperial Marine Lieutenant Grace Tolliver to lead her platoon into the Singularity as a privateer. Her mission: to tear a great bloody strip off their enemies and to take anything that isn't nailed down. The collision of this unlikely pair will change the humanity in ways that no one could predict. If they survive.</p> <p><i>Author's note: This novel takes place more than five centuries before the Empire of Bones series, and the events unfolding here have implications there.</i></p>";
