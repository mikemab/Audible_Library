window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An extraordinary novel of technological espionage and human betrayal, weaving past and present into a web of unbearable suspense.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Thomas Hansard is a brilliant historian at a small New England college. He specializes in Christopher Marlowe. But Hansard has a second secret career with The White Group, a “consulting agency” with shadowy government connections. There, he is a genius at teasing secrets out of documents old and new - to call him a code-breaker is an understatement.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Hansard’s work exposes one of his closest friends as a Russian agent, and the friend then dies mysteriously, the connections seem all too clear. Shaken, Hansard turns away from his secret work to lose himself in an ancient Marlowe manuscript. Surely, a lost 400-year-old play is different enough from modern murder. He is very, very wrong.</p>";
