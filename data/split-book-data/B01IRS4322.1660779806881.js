Everywhere he turns he finds more danger. Everyone who helps him risks their own life. </p> <p>With the Lattice destroyed, the systems the world relies upon have come undone. Global communications are down, food is growing scarce, and the weather is spiraling out of control. Shaw must fight his way across two shell-shocked continents if he ever wants to see his wife again. Unfortunately for him, he must navigate between those who are trying to rebuild the Lattice and those who are willing to kill anyone who might have the expertise or the resources to pull it off. Shaw must choose sides, and the future of the world will rest with his decision. </p>";
