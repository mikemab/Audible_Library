window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One thousand years ago, the Towers on the Isle of Wisdom were beacons of hope. Originally started to train sorcerers, clerics, and warriors to protect the Athanasian Realm, the Towers gave the people a sense of security against the enemies in the Tenebrosity Realm. But when the original Tower members left, that peace was shattered, and now, the Towers have fallen into a state of decline.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now run by the Merila, the Mahatma, the Towers are not what they used to be. Magic users are practically impotent. The knowledge of the past has been hidden away, keeping everyone complacent and weak. Protecting the Athanasian Realm seems almost impossible now. When the current Luminary, Eliza, is poisoned and loses her powers, Merila appoints Eliza’s Second, Adicia, to the position. Adicia, though, isn’t quite as gullible and naïve as Merila thinks she is.&nbsp;</p> <p>When things start spiraling out of control around the time of the Springtime Celebration, Adicia and he friends Tavis and Gara discover things aren’t quite what they seem. Orc attacks, ignored cries for help, and youth with magic abilities that haven’t been seen in years force Adicia and her friends on a quest to track down the only man who can help them. There’s only one problem - Garnrin is not only retired, he’s also the only one who can bring Merila down.&nbsp;</p> <p>Adicia and her friends must fight rogue magic users, goblins, and hell hounds, all while trying to uncover the truth about the Towers, the Realm, and everything in-between. Can they bring the Towers back to their former glory, or will their quest lead to the destruction of the entire Athanasian Realm?</p>";
