Smit has defeated those who would take over his home, and all he wants is a bit of peace and quiet with his family. But alas, fate has other plans in store. A demonic lord from the deepest pits of the underworld is ready to unleash every corrupted spirit and demon at her disposal to capture him.</p> <p>Forced to fight an ancient entity that weaves plans within plans, Smit will have to use all his inventiveness and cunning to lure the demonic horde into a trap.
