They’re starting with a place in the Cook Islands, but to succeed, they have to avoid spies, figure out how to manufacture the new technology using Earth-based tools, and then introduce it without getting into too much trouble with the governments and big corporations of Earth.</p> <p>Come listen along as they build their team from the initial five to enough to run and protect a city. They’re preparing to take the human race into space, but will they succeed before someone manages to take over their spaceship and technology? And can they finish before the Paraxeans come looking for their spaceship?</p>";
