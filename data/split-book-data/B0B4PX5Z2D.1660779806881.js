window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Making a place for yourself in a world where you don’t belong takes courage. So does moving in with a warlock. Especially one who is a cauldron of seething anger on his worst days…half-mad on his best…who is thinking, perhaps, of killing you. And you can almost understand why he would do it. But you’ll fight to stay alive. Because maybe…just maybe…you’ve found the place where you belong: On his world, in his magic, saving the warlock from himself.</p> <p>Waterspell, in four books, tells the story of the lost traveler, Carin, who is drawn into the schemes of a hot-tempered, emotionally damaged wizard. Does he view her as nothing more than an expendable weapon in his fight to save his world from lethal alien plagues? Or will Lord Verek find himself wavering when it comes time to dispose of his fiery water-sylph?</p> <p><b>From the Publisher</b></p> <p>Waterspell springs from the realm of high fantasy (with an eco-fantasy twist). It’s got ancient and mysterious magic, a passage from one world to the otherworld, a (reluctant) Chosen One, a Hero/Heroine’s Quest, and a search for belonging and redemption. It’s a portal fantasy with complex characters and gothic sensibilities. There’s mystery, murder, and a little slow-burning, unconventional romance. Think \"<i>Jane Eyre</i> meets a sorcerer\".</p>";
