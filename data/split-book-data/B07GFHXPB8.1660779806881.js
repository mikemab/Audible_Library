window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An amusing Medieval tale on the same wavelength as the highly acclaimed OUTLANDER</p> <p>Enjoy the complete series now</p> <p>Being a genius Medical school graduate and a sporty and active girl, Aliya dies suddenly in a car accident... only to find herself reborn in a completely different body in the middle of a half-ruined castle during Medieval times. While confused and dismayed, Aliya realizes she has been given a second chance in life - so she rolls up her sleeves and gets to work on restoring the castle and her new life.</p> <p>Aliya has an unusual and difficult goal: she is reborn as Countess Lilian; she has to adjust to an unfamiliar world while trying to introduce the everyday conveniences from her familiar modern world. She needs to take care of the collapsing estate of Earton and its inhabitants while living in the past as a disenfranchised woman. Regular robbers and slave-trader attacks wonâ€™t leave her in peace, killers and spies, sent by the narcissistic aristocracy, are just waiting for her to show a bit of weakness so that they can strike. On the other hand, there exist a prospect of meeting with her perpetually absent husband whom, by the way, after her rebirth as Countess Lilian, Aliya has never seen.</p> <p>Her plan is to make the best of her unusual circumstances to make the world better. She is not a girl in trouble waiting for a prince in shining armor - she strives to achieve everything herself.</p> <p>\"First Lessons\" is the opening book of the bestselling historical and time travel fantasy \"A Medieval Tale\" series by Lina J. Potter. The heroine finds herself only at the beginning of a thorny path to progress and happiness. She makes her first steps, building a defense for herself, her new friends, and her rapidly developing business empire - and this is no piece of cake for sure. Despite everything, she has to still go up against the unprogressive and sexist society of the Medieval Ages, with only her knowledge, experience, and strong will on her side. Still, Lilian has to act carefully in order not to draw too much attention to her innovations - she knows she could be praised for her genius, or conversely, accused of witchcraft.</p>";
