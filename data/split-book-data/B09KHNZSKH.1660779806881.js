window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nothing in the Corps is guaranteed!</p> <p>Staff Sergeant Eli Vanhorn isn't the man he used to be. Once a proud member of the Fleet Marine Corps' elite Terrestrial Advance Combat teams, the battle on colony planet Luyten C left him broken and scarred. But after a year of surgeries and physical therapy, he's ready to complete his enlistment as Master of Arms on the exploration vessel Rihla. It should be a simple, stress free assignment - but things rarely work out as they should.</p> <p>For decades, humanity's efforts to spread across the galaxy have been hampered by the violent Orrkasi, an intelligent, space faring race of which little is known. But Staff Sergeant Vanhorn is no stranger to the Orrkasi. He's a veteran with eight combat engagements, a hardened warrior, a man who knows how to improvise, adapt, and overcome. But he's facing challenges he never expected before. His body is crippled and scarred, the TAC Team brotherhood he once thrived in see him as a pariah, and he's haunted by the horrors of combat. Just getting through his first cruise after returning to active duty won't be easy.</p>";
