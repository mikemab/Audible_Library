Some are rogues. And some just want to return from the void with their bodies and minds unbroken.... </p> <p>Kerin thon Talisien is the heir to a legendary name. When he was a young boy, his grandfather swooped down from the stars and rescued him from the slums of his homeworld. But with the death of the infamous old streamsurfer, Kerin and his crew have fallen on hard times, exiled from the Starfarers Guild and forced to take on risky contracts in the shadowy margins of the stellar tributary. A strange encounter in a glimmer den offers a chance at redemption and glory...but the stakes are high, with the fate of the Known potentially hanging in the balance.</p>";
