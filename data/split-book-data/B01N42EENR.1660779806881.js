window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Junar is a 17-year-old boy following in the footsteps of his Ace Pilot father, Leif, as a flyer in the Kili-Boranna Guild, better known as The Sky Riders. As if life couldn't get any better, Junar's first year apprenticeship riding the massive birds of the sky, the majestic felrell, takes a fortuitous leap forward when his father is promoted to the most prestigious position in all of Aria-Prime - Timber Pilot. Upon moving to the capital city of Christiana with his family, Junar meets fellow apprentices Liv, a strong-headed and alluring confidante, and Erik, whose favorite pastime is making life miserable for Junar. </p> <p>Junar's world takes an unexpected turn, however, when his father has a startling change of heart about his promotion. Embarrassed by his father's weakness and his mother's past, Junar endeavors to excel in his apprenticeship and distance himself from his family by making his own name in the Guild. He sets his sights on competing in the Champions Race - a cross-world gauntlet whose winner is listed among the greatest felrell pilots in history. </p> <p>But behind the scenes, political factions and government conspiracies collide with Junar's new plans. The young pilot suffers a horrific blow at the hands of the Zy-Adair-the notorious Sky Pirates. And soon, his perfect world is spiraling out of control. </p> <p>From his unsuspecting alliance with the Inventors - dubious tinkerers and social outcasts - to his unlikely associations with the Brologi - the Chancellory Police - Junar must find a way to plead his case before the Chancellor of Aria-Prime and piece together a puzzle that threatens his entire world's way of life. </p>";
