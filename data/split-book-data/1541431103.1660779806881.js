window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Award-winning Jo Walton comes a magical re-imagining of the man who remade 15th-century Florence - in all its astonishing strangeness.</p> <p>Young Girolamo's life is a series of miracles.</p> <p>It's a miracle that he can see demons, plain as day, and that he can cast them out with the force of his will. It's a miracle that he's friends with Pico della Mirandola, the Count of Concordia. It's a miracle that when Girolamo visits the deathbed of Lorenzo \"the Magnificent\", the dying Medici is wreathed in celestial light, a surprise to everyone, Lorenzo included. It's a miracle that when Charles VIII of France invades northern Italy, Girolamo meets him in the field, and convinces him to not only spare Florence but also protect it. It's a miracle than whenever Girolamo preaches, crowds swoon. It's a miracle that, despite the Pope's determination to bring young Girolamo to heel, he's still on the loose...and, now, running Florence in all but name.</p> <p>That's only the beginning. Because Girolamo Savanarola is not who - or what - he thinks he is. He will discover the truth about himself at the most startling possible time. And this will be only the beginning of his many lives.</p>";
