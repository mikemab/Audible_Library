window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new epic fantasy by National Book Award finalist and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Laini Taylor of the Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone trilogy.</b> </p> <p>The dream chooses the dreamer, not the other way around - and Lazlo Strange, war orphan and junior librarian, has always feared that his dream chose poorly. Since he was five years old, he's been obsessed with the mythic lost city of Weep, but it would take someone bolder than he to cross half the world in search of it. Then a stunning opportunity presents itself in the person of a hero called the Godslayer and a band of legendary warriors, and he has to seize his chance or lose his dream forever. </p> <p>What happened in Weep 200 years ago to cut it off from the rest of the world? What exactly did the Godslayer slay that went by the name of god? And what is the mysterious problem he now seeks help in solving? </p> <p>The answers await in Weep, but so do more mysteries - including the blue-skinned goddess who appears in Lazlo's dreams. How did he dream her before he knew she existed? And if all the gods are dead, why does she seem so real? </p> <p>In this sweeping and breathtaking new novel by National Book Award finalist Laini Taylor, author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone trilogy, the shadow of the past is as real as the ghosts who haunt the citadel of murdered gods. Fall into a mythical world of dread and wonder, moths and nightmares, love and carnage. </p> <p><i>Welcome to Weep.</i> </p>";
