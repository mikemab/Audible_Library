window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Return to the Alveria Akademy in an all-new dragon fantasy adventure! </b></p> <p><b><i>Dragon Untameable</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Only one person can save the kingdom from utter darkness - but it will take a power she can’t control.</p> <p>The dragon kingdom of Alveria has enjoyed years of peace under King Lasaro and Queen Kaelan’s reign - until never-ending darkness falls across the land, and ghosts are unleashed from the underworld. As attacks on innocents rise, there’s little the noble dragons can do to protect the people from spirits impervious to magic.</p> <p>Laini Unclaimed is one of the first to face the terrifying ghosts. After a lifetime of rejection, all the orphan wants is to find her place as an accepted member of society. But when the realm plunges into eternal night, her uncontrollable - unheard-of - power awakens: the power over light and dark.</p> <p>Despite whispers of suspicion and blame, Laini refuses to accept she’s responsible for the darkness. Under the king’s guidance, she heads to the prestigious Akademy to learn control of this newfound magic. But even the strong Akademy walls may not keep Laini safe, for a young dragon hunter lurks in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to assassinate her.</p> <p>Now, Laini must discover the source of her powers and banish the darkness covering Alveria - before whispers become a cry for her death.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Dragon Gods</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Loyalty will bind them together - or tear them apart.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nightfall still holds Alveria in its grip. Terrifying ghosts continue to haunt the stricken kingdom, while crops wither in the fields from lack of sunlight. If the light doesn’t return soon, thousands will starve.&nbsp;</p> <p>But a worse fate awaits the Untameables.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Dragon Family</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The only way to save Alveria is to end the war - by any means necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>After horrendous losses among their ranks, the Untameables are still reeling, none more than Laini Unclaimed. The battle against the forces of Hel have stripped Laini of those she loves most. Now with Hel closing in, little hope remains to save the reincarnated gods trapped in the underworld, including Tyr, the young man she loves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Until Laini learns about the Book of Death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When Queen Kaelan returns from the kingdom of Unger, she brings grave news: the darkness that engulfs the Alverian kingdom has spread worldwide - and Unger has joined with Hel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Attack is imminent.</p>";
