From being a supporting actor to winning a leading role, the young man finds out that being a star is real work. His invention of the adjustable faucet and electric hairdryer brings him money, and being in the movies brings him fame, but finding a girl who isn't a gold digger or hanger-on proves to be more difficult. Because finding a lady takes effort...like being nice to them and actually listening while getting to know them.</p> <p><i>In the Movies</i>, book four</p> <p>Rick is now firmly in the movies. As the young man grows in his capabilities both on- and off-screen, he finds out that fame may not be all it is cracked up to be.</p> <p>Finding girls is no longer hard; between the boss' daughter, an old flame, and a bad girl from Hollywood, he has his hands full. Joined by his family in California, they buy a mansion with hidden secrets. The adventure continues, ranging from a stampede to a group of bank robbers running into the Square of Death.</p> <p>For the young, this is a coming-of-age adventure; for those who lived it, it's a trip down memory lane.</p> <p><i>This tongue-in-cheek saga is all true (give or take a lie or two) and contains Easter eggs galore. </i></p>";
