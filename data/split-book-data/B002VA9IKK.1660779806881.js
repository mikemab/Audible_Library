window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action.&nbsp;</p> <p>Who is the Hero of Ages?&nbsp;</p> <p>To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler. But as a result, the Deepness - the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists - is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Having escaped death at the climax of <i>The Well of Ascension</i> only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can't even discuss it with Elend, lest Ruin learn their plans!&nbsp;</p> <p>The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave listeners shaking their heads in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere</i></li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive</i></li> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)</li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> <li><i>Collection</i></li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity </i></li> </ul>";
