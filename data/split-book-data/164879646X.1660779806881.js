window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In his hilarious new sci-fi series, Jim C. Hines introduces the unlikely heroes that may just save the galaxy: a crew of space janitors.</b></p> <p>The Krakau came to Earth to invite humanity into a growing alliance of sentient species. However, they happened to arrive after a mutated plague wiped out half the planet, turned the rest into shambling, near-unstoppable animals, and basically destroyed human civilization. You know - your standard apocalypse.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Krakau’s first impulse was to turn around and go home. (After all, it’s hard to have diplomatic relations with mindless savages who eat your diplomats.) Their second impulse was to try to fix us. Now, a century later, human beings might not be what they once were, but at least they’re no longer trying to eat everyone. Mostly.&nbsp;</p> <p>Marion “Mops” Adamopoulos is surprisingly bright (for a human). As a Lieutenant on the Earth Mercenary Corps Ship Pufferfish, she’s in charge of the Shipboard Hygiene and Sanitation team. When a bioweapon attack wipes out the Krakau command crew and reverts the rest of the humans to their feral state, only Mops and her team are left with their minds intact.</p> <p>Escaping the attacking aliens - not to mention her shambling crewmates - is only the beginning. Sure, Mops and her team of space janitors and plumbers can clean the ship as well as anyone, but flying the damn thing is another matter.&nbsp;</p> <p>As they struggle to keep the Pufferfish functioning and find a cure for their crew, they stumble onto a conspiracy that could threaten the entire alliance...a conspiracy born from the truth of what happened on Earth all those years ago.&nbsp;</p> <p>Performed by Colleen Delany, Jessica Lauren Ball, Bru Ajueyitsi, Joy Jones, Michael Glenn, Gwen Grastorf, Lolita Horne, Megan Graves, Caroline Wolfson, Kay Kerimian, Tuyet Thi Pham, Tony Nam, Dawn Ursula, Jacob Yeh, Kimberly Gilbert, Rose Elizabeth Supan, Danny Gavigan, Julie-Ann Elliott, Nanette Savard, Zeke Alton, Jonathan Feuer, Michael John Casey, Robbie Gay, Tim Getman, Jillian Levine-Sisson, Yasmin Tuazon, Christopher Scheeren, Marni Penning, Terence Aselford, Scott McCormick, Lily Beacon, Duyen Washington.</p>";
