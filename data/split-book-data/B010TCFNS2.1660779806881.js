It was supposed to be a training mission: skip in, find out the Casimir Transmitter had gone dead, report back and wait for resupply from the Fleet. </p> <p>By the time the only surviving member of the team made landfall, it was spectacularly clear that this wasn't a training mission. Now Sgt. Sorilla Aida has a job to do. She has to gather the local survivors, recon the enemy, train a militia, and take the war right to the enemy's doorstep. Just what she trained for.
