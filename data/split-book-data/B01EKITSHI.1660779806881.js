window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Entry number three in the popular Hell's Gate series by 28-time <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author David Weber and Joelle Presby. </p> <p>The war between magically gifted Arcana and psionically talented Sharona continues to rage. The dragon-borne Arcanan assault across five universes has been halted at Fort Salby by a desperate defense, but at atrocious cost. One of those costs was the life of Crown Prince Janaki, heir to the newly created Sharonian Empire, who went knowingly to his death in the tradition expected of the House of Calirath. And another price will be the sacrifice of his younger sister, Grand Imperial Princess Andrin, now heir of Sharona, for the accords creating the Sharonian Empire require the marriage of the heir to the Crown to wed a Uromathian prince. </p> <p>Andrin bears her family's Talent, the Glimpses, which show flashes of events yet to come. She knows the accords must be secured...and, like her brother, she will pay any price, make any sacrifice for her duty to her people. </p> <p>Sharona's soldiers dig in, facing the Arcanans in a tense standoff that cannot last long. Both sides continue rushing reinforcements toward the front, but how do armies fight wars when they can reach one another only through the portals that join the universes? And far, far behind the front, carried by dragons, a young Voice name Shaylar and her husband, Jathmar, hurtle deeper and deeper into Arcanan captivity, their only protection the fierce personal honor of the Andaran officer whose men massacred all of their companions in the horrendous misunderstanding that began the entire conflict. </p> <p>Men and women of honor on both sides must grapple with the terrible costs and deadly secrets of the spreading cataclysm, and in the shadows, those who will balk at neither treason nor murder drive the conspiracies that pour fuel into the furnace. The stakes are high, and the pieces are in motion, but there are factors known not even to the conspirators, and not even a Calirath can Glimpse the final outcome. </p>";
