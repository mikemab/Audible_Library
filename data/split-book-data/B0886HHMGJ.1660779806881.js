window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Teleporter</i> is the second in a series of stories featuring the Hyllis family who tend to inherit talents. The stories are set after a plague-induced apocalypse which resulted in the collapse of civilization and reduced mankind back to iron and horsepower.</p> <p>Eva Hyllis and her ancestors became healers because they could feel the insides of their patients with their talents. This helps them diagnose the underlying causes of many illnesses. Having made a diagnosis, unfortunately, there is often not all that much that they can do to treat the problem. Tarc Hyllis, Eva's son, has telekinesis so that he can \"push\" objects with his mind as well as being able to feel inside of people. This gives him the ability to diagnose bleeding inside someone and then stop that bleeding by applying pressure inside the patient.</p> <p>Now Tarc's sister Daussie proves to be able to teleport small objects. She can remove a gallstone! This is a huge help to patients with gallbladder disease. Can she do more. Unfortunately, the Hyllises have to leave their home in Walterston. Traveling the roads in their day and age can be dangerous. Will their talents also let them protect themselves?</p>";
